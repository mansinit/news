      <td>UAE Central Bank says lenders draw down 77% of Dh50bn facility against Covid-19 impact</td>
      <td>Banks and financial institutions have drawn down more than three quarters of the Dh50 billion worth of interest-free loans provided by the Central Bank of the UAE to relieve businesses and individuals struggling due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBanks in the UAE availed of 77 per cent of the liquidity facility, amounting to Dh38.5bn of the allocated funds in the Targeted Economic Support Scheme (TESS), the banking regulator said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n"The CB UAE has also issued a notice that includes additional clarifications on the deferral requests under the TESS and aims to further facilitate the implementation of the scheme," it said.\n\nThe central bank first rolled out details of TESS in March as it unveiled a Dh100bn stimulus package to support companies and individuals affected by measures taken to stop the spread of the pandemic. This included the Dh50bn of zero-cost collateralised loans now being drawn down and a loosening of banks' capital buffers, giving them more firepower to lend. Further loosening of capital and liquidity buffers has since increased the size of this stimulus to Dh256bn.\n\nBanks that have used 100 per cent of the liquidity facility include Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Emirates NBD, Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates Islamic Bank, Noor Bank, National Bank of Fujairah, Commercial Bank International, Bank of Sharjah and Invest Bank, according to a list published by the Central Bank.\n\nLenders that have drawn down 50 per cent of the facility or more include Arab Bank for Investment &amp; Foreign Trade, Arab Bank, Mashreq Bank, Sharjah Islamic Bank, National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah, National Bank of Umm Al Qaiwain and United Arab Bank.\n\nThe Central Bank also issued a notice clarifying the handling of deferral requests under the scheme, with the aim of facilitating its implementation.\n\nAll banks and financial institutions are required to "consider the specific circumstances of impacted borrowers to receive a deferral of repayment within the TESS," the Central Bank said.\n\nThe options for granting postponements include deferring only the principal of a loan, deferring both interest and principal repayments or deferring interest and profits only.\n\n"The most in-demand option will be for the deferment of both interest/profits and principal repayment, unless the borrower’s circumstances allows for accepting other options," it said.\n\nThe banking regulator said it also welcomed initiatives taken by banks to support and relieve their impacted customers without drawing against the TESS programme available to them.\n\nBanks have announced a series of measures to support customers, including three-month payment holidays on loans, cuts in interest rates and reductions in banking fees.\n\nFor businesses, the regulator ordered lenders to remove requirements for small-and-medium enterprises to have a minimum account balance of Dh10,000 before opening accounts and urged them to speed up account opening times to two days, unless potential customers were deemed to be high-risk under anti money-laundering rules.\n\nFor individuals, other support measures have included increasing the loan-to-value limit banks can offer on home loans, meaning the size of deposit required reduces to 20 per cent for first-time expatriate buyers and 15 per cent for nationals.\n\nGlobally, the pandemic has disrupted daily life, paralysed air travel, wiped out at least $17 trillion (Dh62.4tn) from stock markets worldwide and forced governments to introduce economic stimulus packages worth more than $8tn as countries went into lockdown.\n\nGovernments around the world are beginning to ease the restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the deadly virus, walking a fine line between protecting their people from Covid-19 while resuscitating their economies.</td>

      <td>Phoenix Commodities, the trading and distribution group that was placed into liquidation last month with debts of more than $400 million (Dh1.47 billion), was valued at $1.1bn-$1.24bn as recently as January, according to a document filed by its provisional liquidators.\n\nThe valuation, provided by Deloitte India based on the company's June 2019 accounts, show the speed at which currency trading losses incurred by the company's financial derivatives desk in Dubai led to its decline.\n\nPhoenix Commodities, which was registered in the British Virgin Islands but had its main operating entity, Phoenix Global DMCC (PGD), in Dubai, was undone by “accrued losses incurred by its financial derivative trading desk” in February and March, according to the document seen by The National.\n\n“As losses continued to accrue on PGD’s open trades so did the requirement for the company to post margin calls in the form of cash collateral which it was unable to meet,” the document said, adding the situation was exacerbated by counterparties who were unwilling to let the firm close its trades.\n\nPhoenix Commodities began as a rice trading business in 2001. Its executive chairman, Gaurav Dhawan, became the majority shareholder in 2006 and expanded its activities.\n\nThe group grew turnover to $3.1bn and made a $43.5m profit last year, according to management accounts provided to the provisional liquidators. It had three main divisions - agrifoods, resources (coal and metals trading) and consumer brands.\n\nA company brochure claimed the business was the second-biggest rice trader in the world, but its diversification saw more than 100 corporate entities set up employing over 2,500 people globally.\n\nThe company moved into packing and distribution for other firms and created its own consumer brands, including the Zarah pulses range and a line of biodegradable refuse sacks known as Enviro Care produced at its own plastics factory in Ajman.\n\nThe company engaged restructuring firm Quantuma in March to undertake a review of its finances as the scale of the trading desk's losses grew, and directors attempted “a last ditch financial restructure” of its balance sheet, which ultimately failed and led to the appointment of Quantuma and KRyS Global as provisional liquidators on April 20, according to a document filed by its provisional liquidators.\n\nTheir assessment of the company’s financial position indicated that creditors are facing a substantial shortfall, as the company has assets with a book value of $136m (most of which is inter-company debt) but liabilities of more than $416m, over $400m of which is related to foreign exchange losses.\n\nA meeting of creditors in the British Virgin Islands on May 8 voted to appoint Matt Smith and Ryan Jarvis of Deloitte as the company's joint liquidators, a Quantuma employee told The National.

      <td>UAE borrowers say loan holidays offer much-needed relief amid Covid-19</td>
      <td>As business slowed before grinding to a halt at the end of March, Payal Mirchandani, the chief executive of Pinca Trading, watched as orders and payments dried up from the large retailers that buy from her.\n\nShe slashed the annual sales forecast for her business, which distributes toys and other children's products, while fielding emails and calls from retailers that wanted to extend payment terms, from 60 to 100 days. Then she turned to her banks for relief.\n\nPayment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest ... Payal Mirchandani, Pinca Trading\n\nMashreq Bank, where she has a secured business loan, offered her a three-month payment holiday – a process she describes as quick and “pretty seamless”. Interest will still accrue during this period, but will be charged on the final payments. “Of course it would be great if they didn’t charge the interest at all, but I think it’s fair, and it’s still a support,” says Ms Mirchandani, from Canada who lives in Dubai.\n\nRAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday. “They did their due diligence – they asked us a lot of questions, they wanted us to submit a lot documents. But they were supportive at the end, given that we could prove we had been affected," she says.\n\n“Because we are a distributor selling to retailers, it’s a no-brainer – retailers were shut across the country.”\n\nMs Mirchandani says she breathed a sigh of relief when her banks said yes. “Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest, I’m just grateful that I got it at the time that I did," she adds.\n\nBorrowers across the country have benefited from loan relief from their banks, driven by the UAE Central Bank’s Dh50 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess), part of a Dh100bn package launched on March 14. The overall size of the stimulus was later increased to Dh256bn and by April 23, banks had allocated over 60 per cent of the Dh50bn Tess package, which equates to Dh30bn.\n\nPersonal loans\n\nFor some residents, the process of applying for debt relief has been very smooth. Omar Youssef works for Orora, an events company in Dubai, which has seen most of its business dry up during Covid-19 apart from its animation studio and work on digital campaigns.\n\nHe called HSBC where he has a personal loan and is a priority banking customer and asked for a payment holiday. Due to his 33 per cent salary reduction, the bank offered him a loan holiday of up to three months, without interest or fees, though he has to sign a document each month requesting the payment holiday for an additional month and attesting his income remains reduced.\n\n“It was a very easy procedure," he says. "They send you an online form to complete and sign, and attach the company letter saying you have a salary reduction."\n\nDan Robinson, head of wealth and personal banking at HSBC UAE, said: "Our customers have told us where they need our support most and we have made those areas our focus."\n\nMr Youssef says some of his friends, who have had their incomes affected by Covid-19, did not apply for loan holidays because they thought it would be drawn-out process. “When I saw how easy it was I called my friend and told him he should do it as well," he says.\n\nMost financial relief measures are broadly similar across banks in the country, says Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of the financial comparison website Souqalmal.com. Borrowers who have been financially affected by the pandemic and the resulting movement restrictions have access to penalty-free payment holidays on loans for up to three months, and interest-free instalment plans of up to six months on grocery purchases, school fee payments and utility bill payments made with credit cards, she says.\n\n“Foreign banks have also introduced various financial relief measures, though these vary in structure and scale across individual banks,” Ms Musa adds.\n\nHome loans\n\nMortgage payments are often the biggest single cost faced by home owners and therefore relief from these can ease a significant financial burden.\n\nNatasha Hatherall-Shawe, who owns a marketing, PR and events agency in Dubai, says “overnight” the business lost around 70 per cent of its revenue, as well as facing a slowdown in client payments.\n\nNatasha Hatherall-Shawe, founder of a marketing, PR and events agency, secured relief on her mortgage after her business lost around 70 per cent of its revenue during Covid-19. Anna Nielsen / The National\n\n“It leaves our company cash flow in a very difficult place and I have 20 staff to pay and my priority is to make sure they are paid and OK," says the Briton, who lives in Dubai. "All of my savings and personal money will go into filling the gap left from reduced revenue and clients not paying."\n\nShe received a one-month holiday on her home mortgage with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, though interest will continue to accrue. She was advised by her bank that the remaining loan tenure may increase as an effect of the deferment, while service fees for the request were waived.\n\nMs Hatherall-Shawe says her bank has been responsive and helpful. "I was disappointed at one month initially, but they [then said] that they did offer up more potentially if I met the criteria," she says. "Given the nature of my business and the fact we are unlikely to get anywhere back to normal until September onwards, I am likely to apply.”\n\nThe process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straight forward, according to Arran Summerhill, director of Holo, a mortgage broker in Dubai. Banks typically want to receive an email detailing how the coronavirus has affected a borrower economically, including evidence such as a salary reduction letter, he says.\n\n“We’ve tried with six different banks now. We’ve not had a bank that has come back and actually declined a client’s request,” he says.\n\nClients that have been able to secure deferments include a landlord with multiple units, who was able to receive a loan holiday from the bank partly because his tenants were telling him they were struggling to meet monthly rent payments.\n\nMortgage broker Arran Summerhill says the process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straightforward. Pawan Singh / The National\n\nMr Summerhill, says the impact of a job loss or salary reduction will often be greater on a household than a landlord, who can be expected to have multiple revenue streams.\n\n“We’ve had households who reached out to their lenders and they seem to be very grateful for the fact it’s been a fairly smooth process for the banks to agree these payment delays,” he says.\n\nHaresh Lalwani, managing director at Right Move Mortgage Broker, believes it’s logical for banks to try to provide relief for borrowers at this time and says it is positive for a brand if a lender is proactive.\n\n“People remember which bank supported them during the tough times," he says. "So definitely, it’s a huge plus for them.”\n\nMr Lalwani benefited himself from a rent relief when his landlord, Sultan bin Ali Al Owais Real Estate. announced a 45-day rent waiver for its tenants at the end of March.\n\nCredit cards\n\nWhile relief on rents or loans is commonplace, the situation for credit card debt is also more variable, with some banks offering repayment holidays and others not.\n\nMs Musa says some banks are offering credit card customers the option to postpone their repayments by one month, with deferred interest, while other banks have also reduced their late payment fees on credit cards.\n\nCardholders may also be able to benefit from 0 per cent interest deals on balance transfers, she says. “Some banks are offering this interest-free deal for up to 12 months, making it a great way for cardholders to repay and settle their outstanding credit card debt faster," she adds.\n\nCommercial Bank of Dubai (CBD) is offering a one-month payment holiday for all customers on credit cards and other loans. Customers affected by Covid-19 can also defer their instalments for up to three months.\n\nSo far CBD has helped 3,000 customers in the UAE, says Amit Malhotra, general manager, personal banking group. “We are one of the lead banks in the Dubai banks combined relief measures package offer, and we have also undertaken several other initiatives to support our customers during the current coronavirus pandemic,” he says.\n\nMashreq is also offering a payment holiday of up to three months with no extra fees or charges to “a sizeable number” of the bank’s credit card, home loan and personal loan customers, though current interest rates apply. The banks says it reaching out to these customers directly.\n\nNot all debtors can secure relief from the banks, however. Borrowers who already defaulted on their loans before the crisis are not eligible for financial relief measures such as repayment holidays, despite the financial effects of the crisis worsening their situation, says Ms Musa. Non-residents do not qualify for relief either.\n\n“It is best for such borrowers to approach their bank to see what debt relief options are available to them, and whether the bank can restructure their debts to make repayments more manageable,” she adds.</td>

      <td>As business slowed before grinding to a halt at the end of March, Payal Mirchandani, the chief executive of Pinca Trading, watched as orders and payments dried up from the large retailers that buy from her.\n\nShe slashed the annual sales forecast for her business, which distributes toys and other children's products, while fielding emails and calls from retailers that wanted to extend payment terms, from 60 to 100 days. Then she turned to her banks for relief.\n\nPayment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest ... Payal Mirchandani, Pinca Trading\n\nMashreq Bank, where she has a secured business loan, offered her a three-month payment holiday – a process she describes as quick and “pretty seamless”. Interest will still accrue during this period, but will be charged on the final payments. “Of course it would be great if they didn’t charge the interest at all, but I think it’s fair, and it’s still a support,” says Ms Mirchandani, from Canada who lives in Dubai.\n\nRAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday. “They did their due diligence – they asked us a lot of questions, they wanted us to submit a lot documents. But they were supportive at the end, given that we could prove we had been affected," she says.\n\n“Because we are a distributor selling to retailers, it’s a no-brainer – retailers were shut across the country.”\n\nMs Mirchandani says she breathed a sigh of relief when her banks said yes. “Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest, I’m just grateful that I got it at the time that I did," she adds.\n\nBorrowers across the country have benefited from loan relief from their banks, driven by the UAE Central Bank’s Dh50 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess), part of a Dh100bn package launched on March 14. The overall size of the stimulus was later increased to Dh256bn and by April 23, banks had allocated over 60 per cent of the Dh50bn Tess package, which equates to Dh30bn.\n\nPersonal loans\n\nFor some residents, the process of applying for debt relief has been very smooth. Omar Youssef works for Orora, an events company in Dubai, which has seen most of its business dry up during Covid-19 apart from its animation studio and work on digital campaigns.\n\nHe called HSBC where he has a personal loan and is a priority banking customer and asked for a payment holiday. Due to his 33 per cent salary reduction, the bank offered him a loan holiday of up to three months, without interest or fees, though he has to sign a document each month requesting the payment holiday for an additional month and attesting his income remains reduced.\n\n“It was a very easy procedure," he says. "They send you an online form to complete and sign, and attach the company letter saying you have a salary reduction."\n\nDan Robinson, head of wealth and personal banking at HSBC UAE, said: "Our customers have told us where they need our support most and we have made those areas our focus."\n\nMr Youssef says some of his friends, who have had their incomes affected by Covid-19, did not apply for loan holidays because they thought it would be drawn-out process. “When I saw how easy it was I called my friend and told him he should do it as well," he says.\n\nMost financial relief measures are broadly similar across banks in the country, says Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of the financial comparison website Souqalmal.com. Borrowers who have been financially affected by the pandemic and the resulting movement restrictions have access to penalty-free payment holidays on loans for up to three months, and interest-free instalment plans of up to six months on grocery purchases, school fee payments and utility bill payments made with credit cards, she says.\n\n“Foreign banks have also introduced various financial relief measures, though these vary in structure and scale across individual banks,” Ms Musa adds.\n\nHome loans\n\nMortgage payments are often the biggest single cost faced by home owners and therefore relief from these can ease a significant financial burden.\n\nNatasha Hatherall-Shawe, who owns a marketing, PR and events agency in Dubai, says “overnight” the business lost around 70 per cent of its revenue, as well as facing a slowdown in client payments.\n\nNatasha Hatherall-Shawe, founder of a marketing, PR and events agency, secured relief on her mortgage after her business lost around 70 per cent of its revenue during Covid-19. Anna Nielsen / The National\n\n“It leaves our company cash flow in a very difficult place and I have 20 staff to pay and my priority is to make sure they are paid and OK," says the Briton, who lives in Dubai. "All of my savings and personal money will go into filling the gap left from reduced revenue and clients not paying."\n\nShe received a one-month holiday on her home mortgage with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, though interest will continue to accrue. She was advised by her bank that the remaining loan tenure may increase as an effect of the deferment, while service fees for the request were waived.\n\nMs Hatherall-Shawe says her bank has been responsive and helpful. "I was disappointed at one month initially, but they [then said] that they did offer up more potentially if I met the criteria," she says. "Given the nature of my business and the fact we are unlikely to get anywhere back to normal until September onwards, I am likely to apply.”\n\nThe process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straight forward, according to Arran Summerhill, director of Holo, a mortgage broker in Dubai. Banks typically want to receive an email detailing how the coronavirus has affected a borrower economically, including evidence such as a salary reduction letter, he says.\n\n“We’ve tried with six different banks now. We’ve not had a bank that has come back and actually declined a client’s request,” he says.\n\nClients that have been able to secure deferments include a landlord with multiple units, who was able to receive a loan holiday from the bank partly because his tenants were telling him they were struggling to meet monthly rent payments.\n\nMortgage broker Arran Summerhill says the process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straightforward.

      <td>Contractors are facing delays and additional costs in completing ongoing work and are concerned about their ability to mitigate some of the risks they are facing as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nAlthough construction in the UAE has been deemed a vital industry during the lockdown, allowing work on sites to progress, contractors have told The National they are facing additional time and cost pressures.\n\nThis is not just an issue confined to the UAE alone. Last week Moody's Investors Service said projects globally "will face increased operating difficulties during the coronavirus outbreak associated with staff absences, reduced supply of materials and more onerous workplace practices".\n\nSome project companies and their clients "are discussing temporary relaxations of parts of the performance regime or payment mechanism, or both", the ratings agency said.\n\n“We are seeing clients suspend projects – we have had several projects suspended. We have had some clients say, ‘we’re not suspending but we’d be really happy if you guys slowed down’, and we have other clients who are outright telling us, ‘where you were going to bill us $100 this month ... we want you now to make sure you are going to cap this at $50’,” says Bishoy Azmy, chief executive of Dubai-based Al Shafar General Contracting.\n\nHowever, in terms of making up the additional costs incurred, “neither of us has broached the topic”, Mr Azmy says.\n\n“We’re all recognising that this is quite a global thing. It’s not anybody’s fault. It’s not like the client defaulted, or I defaulted.”\n\nBishoy Samy Edward, chief executive of Dhabi Contracting, says his company is continuing to work around the clock “with my full force” of about 10,000 workers.\n\n“I’m paying salaries for these people and they need to work so they can get paid – the same for me,” he says.\n\n“I cannot afford putting 2,000 people idle in the camps and pay them nothing. There’s no law saying you can put people in camps and pay them no money. It would be a big problem,” he says.\n\nContractors have taken precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. Rules have been introduced, such as limiting the number of workers travelling on buses to and from sites. Typically, buses carry about 60 workers but this has been limited to 20.\n\n“Either I make more trips, which will cost me more, or I just get more buses and transfer everyone at the same time. This is what I am doing because I have a huge fleet of buses. However [that] means more fuel [and] more drivers’ salaries,” Mr Edward says.\n\nHe has written to clients detailing the extra costs being incurred and requesting their support. He also said social distancing can be impractical on some sites, especially in city centres where footprints are tight and rest areas are small.\n\nThe UAE Construction Industry Think Tank, a body co-ordinated by lender Mashreq and industry title MEED, this month called for the introduction of standardised contracts.\n\nA white paper produced by the organisation says contracts are currently written by project owners, meaning the majority of risk in the delivery is borne by the contractor.\n\nThe introduction of a standardised construction contract tailored for the UAE could benefit the $710 billion (Dh2.6 trillion) pipeline of projects that are planned or underway by restricting bad behaviour and reducing disputes, the paper states.\n\n“We’re all recognising that this is quite a global thing. It’s not anybody’s fault," says Bishoy Azy, chief executive of Al Shafar General Contracting. Jeffrey E Biteng / The National\n\nThe additional pressures contractors are facing as a result of Covid-19 has brought this matter to a head, Mashreq Bank’s global head of contracting finance, Mohammad Khader Al Shouli, says.\n\n“I believe there will be a lot of requirements for time extensions, variations and delays without penalties. If that doesn’t really materialise or there is no collaboration on it, I think people will resort to those specific paragraphs in their contracts where force majeure is mentioned,” he says.\n\nForce majeure is a concept in most countries with a civil law code, including the UAE, which will be incorporated in most “construction contracts of any sophistication”, explains Thomas Wilson, a partner at law firm Squire Patton Boggs. In general, it covers an event that “prevents the contractor’s performance of its obligations”.\n\n“Contractual force majeure clauses may cover circumstances such as Covid-19,” says Nesreen Osman, a construction advisory and disputes partner at law firm Pinsent Masons. “Generally, these clauses can excuse a party from its delays but may not allow it to recover additional costs.”\n\nOther contract provisions could help with cost recovery, though, Mr Wilson says.\n\n“In civil law jurisdictions, including the UAE, the law includes provisions for exceptional public circumstances causing performance of a contract not to be impossible but to be extremely burdensome financially. In which case courts or arbitration tribunals can adjust the burdens to the parties to a more reasonable [level]. That’s an interesting provision of the law that will be used when the dust settles, but it is not going to be applicable in all respects and it is not a panacea,” he said.\n\n“Generally, these clauses can excuse a party from its delays but may not allow it to recover additional costs.” Nesreen Osman, partner, Pinsent Masons\n\nOne measure that should be avoided, according to Mr Al Shouli, is the withdrawal of performance bonds, which are sums contractors have to provide at the outset of a contract that typically serve as open-ended guarantees.\n\n“Those instruments need to be now tackled with caution and with care,” he says. “Today, you cannot use them to pressure a contractor or to agree to certain changes or discounts that you used to do in the past because it puts so much pressure on the system, and on the contractor. I believe that a lot of contractors will not be able to survive [withdrawal of bonds].”\n\nThe heads of three major Abu Dhabi government branches - the Department of Economic Development, the Department of Municipalities and Transport and the Department for Culture and Tourism – held meetings with business owners and investors in a number of industries to discuss the impact of Covid-19, including the contracting sector. They heard concerns from contractors about the importance of keeping funding flowing to projects and calls for regulatory consistency, the departments said in a statement on Sunday.\n\n"The challenges faced by the contracting sector and their companies in these circumstances makes us more adamant to increase our cooperation and efforts with all strategic partners concerned to reach immediate and more effective solutions and presenting proposals for quick and more impactful measures that revitalise the sector in the short term, while contributing to enhancing investor confidence in the national economy in the long run,” said the Department of Economic Development's chairman, Mohammed Al Shorafa.\n\nMashreq's Mr Al Shouli says the lender is continuing to extend support to contractors in terms of financing projects that face cashflow disruption and pointed out that in some instances – especially for many government-related projects – payments are being accelerated.\n\n“We used to get within 60 days of certification, now we are getting within 20 days of certification."\n\nHowever, he says non-essential spend – for acquisitions, or anything not related to projects – is being discouraged.\n\nOne of the most pressing issues for contractors currently is repatriating workers whose contracts have ended, given that some countries have temporarily closed borders even for returning nationals, and flights are unavailable.\n\n“Now, a lot of our workforce aren’t even able to go home,” ASGC's Mr Azmy said. “If that’s for two weeks, maybe we can shift them to other sites that are working. If it’s a month maybe we can shift them a little and pay them some of their paid leave. But if it’s three months, obviously we’re not going to be able to take that huge cost ourselves and we’re going to be looking for help either from clients or government. We don’t really know.”</td>

      <td>How to remit money from the UAE during Covid-19</td>
      <td>During the Covid-19 crisis in the UAE, certain needs such as buying groceries and medicine are considered essential.\n\nBut what about sending money home? With its majority expatriate population, the UAE is one of the highest outward remittance countries in the world. Many migrant workers have families in their home countries who depend on them for financial support.\n\nExchange houses and banks are still allowed to open, but some are closed or only operating reduced hours. Money transfer companies in the Emirates have seen a sharp rise in the use of digital channels as residents are told to stay home to prevent the spread of the virus. Yet, that is not an option for the “unbanked”, who don’t have a bank account, credit card or debit card.\n\nAs well as the restrictions, convenience, cost and speed are other factors to consider. Here we guide you through the options to remit money from the UAE, as the worldwide coronavirus outbreak and precautionary measures continue.\n\nThe UAE is one of the largest outbound remittance countries in the world with the vast majority of personal remittances sent through exchange houses. Victor Besa / The National\n\nExchange houses are considered a support service\n\nThe vast majority of personal remittances are sent through exchange houses. Of the Dh165.2 billion sent from the Emirates last year, Dh131.2bn was remitted through exchange houses and Dh34bn through banks, according to the Central Bank’s 2019 annual report.\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis has changed the world as we know it, with more than 2.4 million confirmed cases across the globe and over 165,000 deaths as of Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMost countries around the world, including the UAE, continue to enforce physical distancing and movement restrictions, including business closures, travel bans and stay-home directives.\n\nIn Dubai, residents can apply for a movement permit every three days to buy essentials or an emergency, and every five days for ATM cash withdrawal. A DXB move permit call centre representative (800-737648) said applicants should choose “emergency” if they need to send money home and explain the reason under the description.\n\nRashed Al Ansari, chief executive of Al Ansari Exchange, says exchange houses have been designated by the Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management as a “support service” because “we play an instrumental role in paying wages to a large segment of the workforce here in the UAE through the Wage Protection System (WPS) and also provide remittance services for them”.\n\nThe mandatory Wage Protection System, developed by the central bank, requires every private sector employer to choose a registered agent, such as banks, exchange houses and financial institutions, to record wage payments, ensuring they are paid on time at the agreed rate.\n\nSome exchange houses are closed, while others operate shorter hours\n\nShopping malls and non-essential businesses have closed in the Emirates, following government directives. At first, it was understood that mall branches of banks and exchange houses would be included in the closures. However, Osama Al Rahma, chief executive of Al Fardan Exchange, says the decision depends on a mall's management, business flow and specific government restrictions.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, for example, Al Fardan branches in Al Wahda Mall and Marina Mall have closed, Mr Al Rahma says, while other locations are shut due to the nationwide disinfection drive, such as the Gold Souk branch in Dubai.\n\nOsama Al Rahma, chief executive of Al Fardan Exchange and FERG Vice Chairman, says most exchange house branches remain open. Leslie Pableo / The National\n\nAl Ansari, which has more than 190 branches across the UAE, has only closed a few branches. These include Dubai Outlet Mall, Dubai Mall and Dragon Mart as well as Souq Murshid and Naif in Deira. In Abu Dhabi, Marina Mall and Yas Mall branches are closed, while in Sharjah, Sahara Centre is closed.\n\nOrient Exchange has closed a handful of locations out of its 25 branches in the UAE, says its chief executive Rajiv Raipancholia.\n\nBanks have closed a higher proportion of branches, as most transactions can be carried out online or through ATMs. Emirates NBD, for example, is only operating 17 “strategically located branches nationwide with limited services” from April 11, according to its website. First Abu Dhabi Bank, meanwhile, has temporarily closed 50 of its branches and kept 25 open.\n\nIn Dubai, exchange houses are only allowed to operate between the hours of 8am and 2pm. In the rest of the UAE, they are allowed to operate for longer. It is advisable to call ahead to check the latest updates, as the situation is fluid.\n\nBanks also have reduced branch timings, most choosing to operate from 8am or 9am until 12pm or 1pm.\n\nThere are plenty of online alternatives\n\nIn recent years, exchange houses and banks have ramped up their digital offerings amid rising competition to make transfers more convenient, cheaper and faster. This helps those who do not want to leave the house during Covid-19 to make transfers.\n\nLast week, global low-cost digital money transfer service TransferWise started operating in the UAE, six months after receiving its licence from Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The platform lets users send money online at the mid-market exchange rate – the midpoint between demand and supply for a currency – and charges an upfront, transparent fee.\n\nTransferWise says a quarter of its transactions globally are completed in less than 20 seconds. The service has the added benefit that it is fully online without the need to verify identity in person.\n\nTransferWise, now available in the UAE, is a fully digital money transfer option. Photo courtesy TransferWise\n\nBanks also offer customers digital transfer options, such as Mashreq Bank’s Quick Remit and Emirates NBD’s DirectRemit.\n\nLast month, FAB partnered with MasterCard to offer the payit mobile wallet, which delivers instant remittances to select bank accounts and wallets internationally. There are no fees, while exchange rates are “well benchmarked to the market”, a FAB spokesperson said.\n\n“Bringing this technology to the market as early as possible is crucial now more than ever,” said Hana Al Rostamani, group head of personal banking at FAB.\n\nToTok, an instant messaging app used by more than 20 million people worldwide, launched ToTok Pay for android smartphone owners in the UAE on March 23, with users able to send money to friends and family through ToTok chat.\n\nToTok co-founder Giacomo Ziani hopes the company's contactless and cashless payment method will "play a small part in helping protect public health" in the UAE at this time.\n\nWestern Union, which rolled out its digital money transfer services in the UAE last year, allows customers to make online transfers using debit, credit and pre-paid cards, as well as bank accounts, in its global network of 100 countries.\n\nAdeem Ahamed, managing director of Lulu International Exchange, says Lulu Money has seen its transactions rise 35 per cent relative to January. Photo courtesy Lulu Exchange\n\nMany exchange houses say their money transfer apps have seen a huge sharp rise in demand amid the outbreak. Lulu Money is clocking over 5,000 downloads daily with overall transactions rising 35 per cent relative to January. The company has also handled 6,000 chats per week, a spike of 450 per cent from its earlier average of 5,000 per month.\n\n“The adoption rate to digital has accelerated in recent weeks, as people slowly realise the medium’s inherent advantages,” says Adeeb Ahamed, managing director of Lulu International Exchange. “We have noticed customers switch over to our secure mobile app, Lulu Money, at an exponential rate.”\n\nWhile 90 per cent of Lulu Money's transactions are processed in under 15 seconds, the rest take less than a minute, he says. However, the app can only be used by existing customers who have completed the KYC (Know Your Customer) process in physical branches. New customers must visit branches to verify their identity.\n\nRashed Al Ansari, chief executive of Al Ansari Exchange, says the money transfer operator's digital app has seen a transaction increase of more than 40 per cent in March. Photo courtesy Al Ansari\n\nAl Ansari recorded over 110,000 online transactions in March, an increase of more than 40 per cent. However, transactions made through the mobile app only represent 7 per cent of Al Ansari’s total remittances.\n\n“Despite the surge in mobile app remittance, a large segment of the population still prefers visiting brick-and-mortar branches,” says Mr Al Ansari.\n\nAgain, new customers have to initially visit the branch to verify their identity and, more importantly, digital options are not available to the “unbanked” population.\n\nMr Al Ansari says the exchange house is in the final stages of developing a feature in its mobile app that enables customers to remit money from their WPS card directly without visiting a branch and without the need for a “full-fledged bank account”.\n\nFinTech start-ups, such as Now Money, Rise and Denarii Cash, offer low-cost options to those who don't have a bank account or access to other money transfer methods.\n\nComparing the cost will become key\n\nSeveral variables affect the cost of money transfers, such as the method used, destination and amount to be remitted.\n\n“It’s also important for customers to recognise that although the headline exchange rate can seem attractive, when fees are added the overall cost can increase significantly and this should be taken into consideration when comparing costs,” says Graham Flannery, chief executive of Wall Street Exchange.\n\nThe World Bank publishes cost comparisons on its website, covering 12 corridors from the UAE, including top receivers India, Pakistan and the Philippines. It also includes the speed of the transfer, which can vary from less than a minute to a couple of days.\n\nWith the coronavirus crisis, people have become more savvy when it comes to exploring their options.\n\n“Before Covid-19 and after Covid-19, I think we will find a major change in consumer behaviours,” says Mr Al Rahma, who is also vice chairman of the Foreign Exchange and Remittance Group (FERG), representing more than 70 exchange houses in the UAE. “People used to be hesitant to use apps … this will totally change the mindset.”</td>

      <td>Mashreq Bank’s first quarter profit slides amid coronavirus pandemic</td>
      <td>Mashreq Bank, the Dubai lender controlled by the Al Ghurair family, reported a 28 per cent drop in its first-quarter net profit, as global interest rates declined and economic activity remained subdued amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNet profit for the three months ending March 31 declined to Dh450 million, the lender said in a statement to the Dubai Financial Market, where its shares trade. Revenue slid 3 per cent year-on-year to Dh1.52 billion and impairment allowances rose 56.5 per cent to Dh409m.\n\n“These are difficult times for the whole world and despite a tough operating environment, Mashreq continued its positive growth trajectory in the first quarter of 2020,” Ahmed Abdelaal, group chief executive of Mashreq Bank, said.\n\n“We achieved a respectable ... net profit for the first quarter of 2020 despite strong headwinds like steep decline in interest rates and [the] impact of the Covid-19 crisis."\n\nThe lender's revenue also remained stable with loans and advances growing by almost 3 per cent during the reporting period, Mr Abdelaal noted.\n\nInvestment income more than doubled to Dh127m. Net interest income and income from Islamic financing, however, slid 16.5 per cent to Dh782m, Mashreq said.\n\nLenders across the globe are at risk of a decline in profitability as loan growth slows and interest rates plunge amid the coronavirus pandemic. The global economy could experience the worst recession this year since the 1930s great depression. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday projected a 3 per cent contraction in 2020 and said the outlook for the world economy is worse than the 2008 global economic crisis.\n\nThe UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, was the first in the Middle East and North Africa to roll out Dh282bn in fiscal and monetary support, providing zero interest funding to banks to boost lending growth in the country. The government, in addition, has also implemented a variety of other initiatives that range from discounted utility bills to waivers of fees to buttress the economy.\n\nMashreq on Thursday said its assets grew 2 per cent to Dh162.6bn, while loans and advances rose 2.8 per cent from the end of last year to reach Dh78.3bn. Customer deposits, however, fell 2.7 per cent to Dh88.5bn during the period.\n\n“Given the unprecedented situation we are facing now, we invoked several management actions during the quarter, aimed at ensuring the safety and security of all our stakeholders as well as supporting their financial well-being,” said Mr Abdelaal.\n\nMashreq is among UAE banks that have rolled out a comprehensive package to reduce financial distress of their clientele. Banking benefits packages extend relief to businesses and individuals, particularly in stressed sectors, through reduced costs and fees, loan deferrals, reduced interest rates and processing fees.\n\nEarlier this month, the UAE Central Bank urged lenders to support the private sector and individual borrowers to cushion the impact of Covid-19 and disbursed Dh10bn worth of zero interest loans to banks from the Targeted Economic Support Scheme launched in March.</td>

Customer deposits, however, fell 2.7 per cent to Dh88.5bn during the period.\n\n“Given the unprecedented situation we are facing now, we invoked several management actions during the quarter, aimed at ensuring the safety and security of all our stakeholders as well as supporting their financial well-being,” said Mr Abdelaal.\n\nMashreq is among UAE banks that have rolled out a comprehensive package to reduce financial distress of their clientele. Banking benefits packages extend relief to businesses and individuals, particularly in stressed sectors, through reduced costs and fees, loan deferrals, reduced interest rates and processing fees.\n\nEarlier this month, the UAE Central Bank urged lenders to support the private sector and individual borrowers to cushion the impact of Covid-19 and disbursed Dh10bn worth of zero interest loans to banks from the Targeted Economic Support Scheme launched in March.</td>

      <td>UAE banks do not require more stimulus from central bank, Al Ghurair says</td>
      <td>Banks in the UAE do not need more stimulus from the central bank to deal with the coronavirus impact, although the government has many tools at its disposal to support the economy if needed.\n\n“The good news is [that] today we do not need more ... what we have [right now] is good,” Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, chairman of the UAE Banks Federation, said. “If things improve, we will return this money and if things deteriorate and the world goes into [a] 10 per cent [economic] shrinkage, there will be a different decision at that time.”\n\nThe Central Bank of the UAE on March 14 rolled out a Dh100 billion ($27bn) stimulus to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus on the country’s economy. The package was boosted to Dh256bn on April 5 when the banking regulator halved banks' capital buffer requirements to 7 per cent. The central bank also extended the duration of the Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess) for affected retail and corporate customers, allowing banks and finance companies to defer the principal amount of loans and interest until the end of this year.\n\nThe aggregate value of all capital and liquidity measures now include Dh50bn in capital buffer relief, Dh50bn in zero-cost funding support, Dh95bn in liquidity buffer relief and a Dh61bn reduction in cash reserve requirements. On the fiscal side, the UAE government has also launched several initiatives worth Dh26bn to reduce the cost of living and support smaller businesses.\n\nOf the Dh256bn central bank initiative, Dh205bn is liquidity made available to the banks for lending, Mr Al Ghurair, who is also chairman of Dubai’s Mashreq bank, said. The remainder is a relief package for individual borrowers and companies in sectors affected by the coronavirus.\n\n“The relief [package] is supposed to be used exclusively for commercial companies and individuals and not to be used to fund GREs [government-related entities] or government institutions,” he noted.\n\nTotal lending in the UAE currently stands at about Dh1.6 trillion, out of which Dh1tn is loaned to individuals and commercial entities. The Dh205bn in available liquidity is enough for the banks to maintain their average annual loan growth over the last five years for the next four, he added.\n\nGovernment and central banks around the world have rolled out monetary and fiscal initiatives to soften the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on businesses. The virus has infected more than 1.7 million people globally and killed close to 110,000, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the outbreak. More than 409,000 people have recovered from the disease.\n\nRate cuts, dedicated liquidity lines, wage protection schemes, loan guarantees and direct aid to households are among the measures that have already been implemented in a number of countries.\n\n“Today we have enough liquidity to look after our requirements and to support our economy to ensure it comes out of this challenge,” Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, chairman of the UAE Banks Federation, said\n\nThe UAE, Mr Al Ghurair said, has several such tools to support the economy. Lowering tariffs and fees, an SME loan guarantee programme, employee salary guarantees or even the federal government buying back government loans are some of the options.\n\n“Today we have enough liquidity to look after our [lending] requirements and to support our economy to ensure it comes out of this challenge,” he noted.\n\nOn the debt crisis facing the embattled UAE healthcare firm NMC Health, Mr Al Ghurair said the decision to put the company under administration is a protective move. It ensures that “there’s no playing around with whatever money is there” and also to protect the records.\n\nA UK court placed Abu Dhabi-based NMC Health into administration last week on the request Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, its biggest lender, which has an exposure of $981 million (Dh3.6bn) to the healthcare company. The size of its lending increases to $1.16bn when factoring in Finablr, another company owned by NMC Health's founder BR Shetty, which is not in administration. Overall, UAE banks have a combined exposure of at least Dh8bn to NMC Health.\n\nIt is in interest of banks to keep NMC business going “as long as possible” to recover their money, he added.\n\n“If you present their balance sheet today, people will still lend them. Banks do not plan for fraud … this is a world-class fraud,” Mr Al Ghurair said. “I think the management and the board members [of NMC] should be held accountable.”</td>

      <td>The UAE’s publicly-listed companies began reporting their exposure to NMC Health, the embattled healthcare operator, which is at risk of being placed into administration.\n\nAs of Sunday, banks in the UAE had declared a combined exposure of about Dh8.04 billion ($2.16bn) in the form of loans to the group and its subsidiaries.\n\nAbu Dhabi Commercial Bank, the company’s biggest individual lender, is owed $981 million, it said in a statement to the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange last week. ADCB on Saturday said it has approached the UK's High Court to place NMC Health into administration “to protecting its interest and assuring the long-term sustainability of the company”.\n\nDubai Islamic Bank, the largest Sharia-compliant lender in the UAE, said it is owed $425m.

In conjunction with other substantial creditors, the bank is now in discussions with the group and its advisers to ascertain the group’s financial position and identify potential measures to address the group’s governance and financial issues,” DIB said in a statement to the Dubai Financial Market, where its shares trade.\n\nThe lender said it is “taking appropriate actions to protect its interests and fully appreciates the vital role that the group’s healthcare services play in our local communities, particularly at this time”.\n\nAbu Dhabi Islamic Bank reported loan exposure of $291.4m to the healthcare company, and said it had a $31m investment in a sukuk issued by the company.

      <td>The banking and finance industry is vital to the financial health of the country and its main trade body is working “hand in hand” with the central bank to ensure continuity of operations, the chairman of the UAE Banks Federation said.\n\n“As a critical industry, the banking sector has an especially unique responsibility to safeguard society and the economic environment,” Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, who is also the chairman of Dubai-based Mashreq bank, said following the first virtual meeting of the UBF board.\n\n“This will continue to be our utmost priority, and we will do whatever it takes to fullfil our mandate to support banks and [the] local community as we navigate through this uncertainty together.”\n\nThe meeting also discussed initiatives that UBF, a body representing 53 lenders in the country, will roll out this year. These measures are aimed at increasing innovation in the banking industry, enhancing Emiratisation and supporting the country's real estate sector, a significant contributor to national economic activity.\n\nSupport for the real estate sector and development of the mortgage market in the UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, were among the priorities laid out by the Central Bank of the UAE in its Dh100 billion economic stimulus package announced earlier this month.\n\nThe regulator's Targeted Economic Support includes Dh50bn from central bank funds through collateralised loans at zero cost to all banks operating in the UAE and Dh50bn of funds freed from banks’ capital buffers. The package also includes measures that will help facilitate access to finance for small and medium-sized firms and reduce fees that will help soften the impact of Covid-19 on the country’s economy.\n\nThe package will “give a significant boost to the UAE banking sector and have [a] far-reaching impact on various sectors that underpin the economy”, Mr Al Ghurair said in a March 15 statement. “The UAE banking sector has sufficient liquidity and is adequately capitalised and we are well-positioned to weather challenges that lie ahead.”\n\nDubai banks – including Emirates NBD, Mashreq, Commercial Bank of Dubai, Dubai Islamic Bank and Emirates Islamic – have already released a package of financial initiatives for their clientele, which includes fee waivers and loan instalment holidays. Abu Dhabi lenders, including First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, have also offered similar relief to their customers in a bid to help ease financial strains.\n\n“It is important that we [do] not lose sight of our vision during these difficult times, and continue to promote growth and transformation across the industry for the benefit of the wider country,” Mr Al Ghurair said.\n\n“Whether it is tackling the ever-changing challenges in the market, or fostering policies and frameworks to drive innovation, we are continuously working towards a sustainable and diversified economy to secure a better future for the entire nation.”</td>

      <td>Are foreign banks in the UAE helping customers affected by Covid-19?</td>
      <td>As the coronavirus outbreak continues to ravage economies across the globe, major banks in the UAE have rolled out measures to provide financial relief to customers.\n\nThe measures – which include payment holidays for between one to three months, reductions in cash advance charges and a lower down payment for first-time home buyers – are in line with the UAE Central Bank’s Dh100 billion economic stimulus package unveiled on March 14.\n\nBut what about foreign banks in the UAE, including Citi, HSBC and Standard Chartered? They too have taken action to help customers cope with the financial fallout from the efforts to contain Covid-19.\n\nWhile Dubai banks – including Emirates NBD, Mashreq, Commercial Bank of Dubai, Dubai Islamic Bank and Emirates Islamic – and Abu Dhabi banks – including First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank – have co-ordinated and released common financial initiatives in each emirate, foreign banks have released initiatives individually. The measures, as well as the criteria for customers to qualify, vary.\n\nWorldwide, there are over 723,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with more than 34,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins as of Monday. More than 152,000 have recovered. In the UAE, there are 570 cases with three deaths and 58 recoveries.\n\nContainment measures in the UAE, such as stay-at-home directives and business closures, could cause a decline in revenue for companies, and a cut in income or job losses for individuals.\n\nHere we break down what Citi, HSBC and Standard Chartered are doing to help those affected by Covid-19 in the Emirates, either directly or indirectly.\n\nCiti Group, which has its headquarters in New York, had total assets of around $1.9tn last year. Joseph J Capellan / The National\n\nCiti\n\nEarlier this month, Citi made fund transfers free through the mobile app until April 30. It also said it would donate 0.5 per cent of all debit card spends in the month of March to help with the efforts to combat Covid-19.\n\nThe bank introduced additional measures last week and is in the process of rolling out others, Dinesh Sharma, head of Citi's Middle East consumer bank division, told The National. Citi has around 300,000 customers in the UAE.\n\nIf customers with existing loans are facing reduced cash flow, a temporary loss of payment or redundancy, they can apply for a 75 per cent reduction in their monthly instalments with significantly lower interest. “If a customer was paying Dh1,000 a month, that can go down to Dh250,” Mr Sharma says. Previously, the rewrite programme allowed customers to apply for a reduction of up to 50 per cent.\n\nCustomers facing difficulties for a short period of time have the option to request a payment holiday through the bank’s “skip a payment” programme, Mr Sharma says. Previously clients could apply for a payment holiday of up to two months. Now, they can defer the principle payments for three months and then ask to extend it by another three months.\n\n“In total, a customer can get a temporary relief of six months or he/she can get permanent relief on a restructure in case the difficult situation is permanent,” Mr Sharma says. “Close to 200 customers have already approached us,” he added.\n\nCiti is looking into reducing credit card cash advance charges by 50 per cent, as local banks have done. However, Mr Sharma says this feature is used by less than 10 per cent of its customers in the UAE market.\n\n“Our main focus is to make sure the features we’re providing are making a real difference to customers, so we also look at the usage rates,” he said.\n\nSimilar to local banks, Citi has removed the Dh2 fee to use other banks' ATMS for three months from April 1 until June 30.\n\nThe bank has approved waiving the fee on its “Citi PayAll” programme, which allows customers to pay for rent, property maintenance, education, travel plans and special events in monthly instalments using their credit card. The fee, as per the December 2019 schedule of fees and charges, is up to 4 per cent of the transaction amount plus VAT.\n\nThe rewrite and payment holiday programmes are applied on a case-by-case basis, while the free transfers, temporary waiver of ATM charges and removal of Citi PayAll fee are for all customers.\n\nWhen asked what constitutes being “affected” by Covid-19, Mr Sharma said: “It could be anything. It could be that somebody in the family has contracted the virus or is in quarantine. It could be customers who have been asked to go on leave without payment … No one is excluded.”\n\nOn a global level, the Citi Foundation said on March 19 it will provide $15 million (Dh55m) to support relief activities related to Covid-19.\n\nHSBC will spend $1.2 million on charitable projects in Menat region to help individuals and families impacted by coronavirus. Photo: Reuters\n\nHSBC\n\nHSBC has released “Covid-19 guidance and FAQs” on its UAE website. It outlines a package of measures, effective immediately, to help its customers and “contribute to the initiatives announced by the Central Bank of the UAE to support the country’s economy”.\n\n“We are staying very close to all of our customers – our priority is to work with them and help them navigate any challenges they currently face,” Daniel Robinson, head of retail banking and wealth management at HSBC UAE, told The National. The bank's relief measures include:\n\n• Customers who have been placed on unpaid leave by their employers can apply for a one-month repayment holiday without interest and fees for their personal loans, mortgages and car loans.\n\n• Charges will be refunded on cash withdrawals and balance enquiries made at all non-HSBC ATMs across the UAE and GCC (in place since March 15).\n\n• School fees paid by credit card qualify for an instalment plan of up to six months starting from 0 per cent interest with processing fees waived.\n\n• All first-time home buyers can benefit from a 5 per cent increase in the loan-to-value ratio for mortgages.\n\nThese are similar to measures introduced by Dubai and Abu Dhabi banks. However, local lenders are offering a repayment holiday of up to three months for those placed on unpaid leave and all customers are eligible for one-month payment holidays.\n\nHSBC customers can also apply for temporary increases in credit card limits, subject to eligibility. The bank has increased daily ATM cash withdrawal and purchase limits since March 19.\n\nThe bank is encouraging clients to contact their relationship manager for help and make use of the automated phone banking service, rather than visiting a branch.\n\nHSBC said last week it is providing $25m in charitable donations to support the international medical response, protect vulnerable people and ensure food security around the world.\n\nStandard Chartered, which has its headquarters in London and is present in around 70 countries, managed $720bn in assets in 2019. Photo: Reuters\n\nStandard Chartered\n\nStandard Chartered in the UAE has launched a series of measures “to help ease the financial burden" on their clients, effective from April 1 to June 30, according to a post on its website.\n\nThese include:\n\n• All clients affected by Covid-19 can ask the bank for a three-month repayment holiday on their existing personal loans, car loans and mortgages with zero interest and fees.\n\n• All clients can choose to pay only the interest component of their existing loan for a period of three months.\n\n• For credit card transactions over Dh1,000 on hospital fees, school fees, utility bills and grocery payments, purchases can be converted into equal monthly instalments at 0 per cent interest and no processing fees.\n\n• The foreign currency transaction fees on cancelled travel bookings will be refunded.\n\n• Cash advance fees on credit cards will be cut in half.\n\nOnly UAE residents are eligible for the relief measures and it is limited to clients who are “up-to-date with their payment obligations”.\n\nThose who are financially affected by Covid-19 can avail the measures by sending an email to covid.19relief@sc.com.

      <td>As the coronavirus outbreak continues to ravage economies across the globe, major banks in the UAE have rolled out measures to provide financial relief to customers.\n\nThe measures – which include payment holidays for between one to three months, reductions in cash advance charges and a lower down payment for first-time home buyers – are in line with the UAE Central Bank’s Dh100 billion economic stimulus package unveiled on March 14.\n\nBut what about foreign banks in the UAE, including Citi, HSBC and Standard Chartered? They too have taken action to help customers cope with the financial fallout from the efforts to contain Covid-19.\n\nWhile Dubai banks – including Emirates NBD, Mashreq, Commercial Bank of Dubai, Dubai Islamic Bank and Emirates Islamic – and Abu Dhabi banks – including First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank – have co-ordinated and released common financial initiatives in each emirate, foreign banks have released initiatives individually. The measures, as well as the criteria for customers to qualify, vary.\n\nWorldwide, there are over 723,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with more than 34,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins as of Monday. More than 152,000 have recovered. In the UAE, there are 570 cases with three deaths and 58 recoveries.\n\nContainment measures in the UAE, such as stay-at-home directives and business closures, could cause a decline in revenue for companies, and a cut in income or job losses for individuals.\n\nHere we break down what Citi, HSBC and Standard Chartered are doing to help those affected by Covid-19 in the Emirates, either directly or indirectly.\n\nCiti Group, which has its headquarters in New York, had total assets of around $1.9tn last year. Joseph J Capellan / The National\n\nCiti\n\nEarlier this month, Citi made fund transfers free through the mobile app until April 30. It also said it would donate 0.5 per cent of all debit card spends in the month of March to help with the efforts to combat Covid-19.\n\nThe bank introduced additional measures last week and is in the process of rolling out others, Dinesh Sharma, head of Citi's Middle East consumer bank division, told The National. Citi has around 300,000 customers in the UAE.\n\nIf customers with existing loans are facing reduced cash flow, a temporary loss of payment or redundancy, they can apply for a 75 per cent reduction in their monthly instalments with significantly lower interest. “If a customer was paying Dh1,000 a month, that can go down to Dh250,” Mr Sharma says. Previously, the rewrite programme allowed customers to apply for a reduction of up to 50 per cent.\n\nCustomers facing difficulties for a short period of time have the option to request a payment holiday through the bank’s “skip a payment” programme, Mr Sharma says. Previously clients could apply for a payment holiday of up to two months. Now, they can defer the principle payments for three months and then ask to extend it by another three months.\n\n“In total, a customer can get a temporary relief of six months or he/she can get permanent relief on a restructure in case the difficult situation is permanent,” Mr Sharma says. “Close to 200 customers have already approached us,” he added.\n\nCiti is looking into reducing credit card cash advance charges by 50 per cent, as local banks have done. However, Mr Sharma says this feature is used by less than 10 per cent of its customers in the UAE market.\n\n“Our main focus is to make sure the features we’re providing are making a real difference to customers, so we also look at the usage rates,” he said.\n\nSimilar to local banks, Citi has removed the Dh2 fee to use other banks' ATMS for three months from April 1 until June 30.\n\nThe bank has approved waiving the fee on its “Citi PayAll” programme, which allows customers to pay for rent, property maintenance, education, travel plans and special events in monthly instalments using their credit card. The fee, as per the December 2019 schedule of fees and charges, is up to 4 per cent of the transaction amount plus VAT.\n\nThe rewrite and payment holiday programmes are applied on a case-by-case basis, while the free transfers, temporary waiver of ATM charges and removal of Citi PayAll fee are for all customers.\n\nWhen asked what constitutes being “affected” by Covid-19, Mr Sharma said: “It could be anything. It could be that somebody in the family has contracted the virus or is in quarantine. It could be customers who have been asked to go on leave without payment … No one is excluded.”\n\nOn a global level, the Citi Foundation said on March 19 it will provide $15 million (Dh55m) to support relief activities related to Covid-19.\n\nHSBC will spend $1.2 million on charitable projects in Menat region to help individuals and families impacted by coronavirus. Photo: Reuters\n\nHSBC\n\nHSBC has released “Covid-19 guidance and FAQs” on its UAE website. It outlines a package of measures, effective immediately, to help its customers and “contribute to the initiatives announced by the Central Bank of the UAE to support the country’s economy”.\n\n“We are staying very close to all of our customers – our priority is to work with them and help them navigate any challenges they currently face,” Daniel Robinson, head of retail banking and wealth management at HSBC UAE, told The National. The bank's relief measures include:\n\n• Customers who have been placed on unpaid leave by their employers can apply for a one-month repayment holiday without interest and fees for their personal loans, mortgages and car loans.\n\n• Charges will be refunded on cash withdrawals and balance enquiries made at all non-HSBC ATMs across the UAE and GCC (in place since March 15).\n\n• School fees paid by credit card qualify for an instalment plan of up to six months starting from 0 per cent interest with processing fees waived.\n\n• All first-time home buyers can benefit from a 5 per cent increase in the loan-to-value ratio for mortgages.\n\nThese are similar to measures introduced by Dubai and Abu Dhabi banks. However, local lenders are offering a repayment holiday of up to three months for those placed on unpaid leave and all customers are eligible for one-month payment holidays.\n\nHSBC customers can also apply for temporary increases in credit card limits, subject to eligibility. The bank has increased daily ATM cash withdrawal and purchase limits since March 19.\n\nThe bank is encouraging clients to contact their relationship manager for help and make use of the automated phone banking service, rather than visiting a branch.\n\nHSBC said last week it is providing $25m in charitable donations to support the international medical response, protect vulnerable people and ensure food security around the world.\n\nStandard Chartered, which has its headquarters in London and is present in around 70 countries, managed $720bn in assets in 2019. Photo: Reuters\n\nStandard Chartered\n\nStandard Chartered in the UAE has launched a series of measures “to help ease the financial burden" on their clients, effective from April 1 to June 30, according to a post on its website.\n\nThese include:\n\n• All clients affected by Covid-19 can ask the bank for a three-month repayment holiday on their existing personal loans, car loans and mortgages with zero interest and fees.\n\n• All clients can choose to pay only the interest component of their existing loan for a period of three months.\n\n• For credit card transactions over Dh1,000 on hospital fees, school fees, utility bills and grocery payments, purchases can be converted into equal monthly instalments at 0 per cent interest and no processing fees.\n\n• The foreign currency transaction fees on cancelled travel bookings will be refunded.\n\n• Cash advance fees on credit cards will be cut in half.\n\nOnly UAE residents are eligible for the relief measures and it is limited to clients who are “up-to-date with their payment obligations”.\n\nThose who are financially affected by Covid-19 can avail the measures by sending an email to covid.19relief@sc.com. They must provide certain documents to claim temporary relief from payments, such as: a letter from the employer stating the impact of Covid-19 as the reason for unpaid leave or termination; a note from the Ministry of Health confirming you were infected by Covid-19; evidence that Covid-19 has directly or indirectly affected the ability to pay due to travel restrictions or quarantine; or bank statements reflecting the revenue loss of more than 20 per cent, month on month, if self-employed.\n\nOn Monday, Standard Chartered said it would commit $1bn of financing for companies worldwide that provide goods and services to help the fight against Covid-19, or those who plan to switch into making products that are in high demand to address the crisis. The bank will provide, at preferential rates, the money in the form of loans, import/export finance or the working capital facilities companies use for day-to-day business operations.</td>

The overall package equates to 6.4 per cent of UAE lenders' domestic credit as of January.\n\nThe regulator ordered banks to use the funding “to grant temporary relief” to private sector corporate customers and retail clients for up to six months. The Central Bank has also reduced the amount of capital banks have to hold for their loans to SMEs by 15 to 25 per cent. This will increase available financing to small companies.

      <td>Banks in Dubai will offer their customers and clients loan repayment holidays and reduced charges to help soften the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on their finances and relieve economic pressure.\n\nThe pandemic is hammering the global economy, disrupting trade and has brought the travel and tourism sector almost to a grinding halt.\n\nEmirates NBD, the biggest bank by assets in Dubai along with UAE’s largest Sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates Islamic, Mashreq, and Commercial Bank of Dubai have announced a series of support measures that will remain in effect for three months starting April 1, the Dubai government media office said on Saturday.\n\nThe measures support the plans that have already been put in place by the UAE government to “keep the UAE safe and prosperous”, Emirates NBD chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed , said. “We recognise the need to protect those most vulnerable and are committed to lending a helping hand during this uncertain time."\n\nThe measures follow the Central Bank of the UAE's Dh100 billion stimulus unveiled earlier this month, and separate packages from the Abu Dhabi and Dubai government that entail reduced or exempted fees for a range of services. The UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, joined governments and central banks around the world in announcing emergency economic packages and safety measures, to contain the spread of the coronavirus and soften the impact on their economies.\n\nThe virus, which has its roots in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 278,000 people and at least 11,570 have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Italy, Spain and Iran are among the worst hit countries outside of China, as nations across Europe, Middle East and North America close borders and implement travel restrictions.\n\nThe relief measures from conventional banks including Emirates NBD, Mashreq and Commercial Bank of Dubai extend to the lenders’ retail, business and small and medium-sized enterprises clientele.\n\nRetail loan customers placed on unpaid leave by their employers can approach the banks for repayment holidays of up to three months with zero interest and fees. Those who have taken out personal loans, auto loans or mortgages can apply for a one-month repayment holiday with no fees.\n\nFor mortgage clients, the banks are offering all first time homebuyers a 5 per cent increase in the Loan-to-Value ratio (LTV) and full waiver of processing fees. Customers will also be able to get a refund of charges on cash withdrawals using debit cards on ATMs of other banks across the UAE.\n\nCredit card customers will be allowed interest-free installment plans for all school fee payments as well as grocery purchases with no processing fees for up to six months.\n\nCustomers who cancel their travel bookings done through credit and debit cards will receive refund of the foreign currency transaction fees already charged by the bank. Customers using credit cards for cash withdrawals will have to pay half cash advance charges.\n\n“We fully recognise the importance of assisting our customers, businesses and communities in these challenging times through these relief measures and we place the highest priority on ensuring the welfare and happiness of the society and all those living in the country,” said Abdul Al Ghurair, chairman of Mashreq Bank.\n\nSyrian Red Crescent vehicles spraying disinfectant along a street in the capital Damascus.

Profit for the period fell “due to higher IFRS 9 provisions that are set as precautionary measures to combat the economic impact of the novel coronavirus", the lender said.\n\nNet provision for credit loss climbed 39 per cent year-on-year to Dh480.4m. Net interest income and net income from Islamic financing also rose almost 2 per cent to Dh696m, while non-interest income dropped 4 per cent to Dh305m during the period.\n\n“Like most banks globally we have taken the pre-emptive judgemental overlays in our IFRS 9 provisions to factor in the challenges that lie ahead, which has led to additional provisions of just over Dh130m for the quarter,” RAKBank chief executive Peter England said in a statement.\n\n“RAKBank is very well positioned to weather the current challenges with very high levels of capital, liquidity and precautionary provisions, leaving us in a very strong position to help our clients through these very challenging times.”\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses of the bank dropped 4.49 per cent year-on-year to Dh367.2m.\n\nTotal assets at the end of the first quarter grew 4.6 per cent to Dh59.8bn, but loans and advances dropped almost 1 per cent from the end of the last year to Dh34.3bn. Customer deposits increased 3 per cent to Dh37.8bn during the first three months of 2020.\n\nLenders worldwide are facing a decline in profitability as loan growth slows and interest rates fall as central banks embark on monetary easing measures to support their economies.\n\nThe global economy is facing its deepest recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s and is projected to shrink 3 per cent in 2020, the International Monetary Fund said last month. The outlook is worse than the 2008 financial crisis and the IMF does not expect a recovery to take place before 2021.\n\nThe UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, has rolled out Dh282bn in fiscal and monetary support, including a Dh256bn package of measures from the central bank, which has provided zero interest funding to banks to encourage lending growth, as well as relaxing capital and liquidity buffers.

      <td>UAE borrowers say loan holidays offer much-needed relief amid Covid-19</td>
      <td>As business slowed before grinding to a halt at the end of March, Payal Mirchandani, the chief executive of Pinca Trading, watched as orders and payments dried up from the large retailers that buy from her.\n\nShe slashed the annual sales forecast for her business, which distributes toys and other children's products, while fielding emails and calls from retailers that wanted to extend payment terms, from 60 to 100 days. Then she turned to her banks for relief.\n\nPayment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest ... Payal Mirchandani, Pinca Trading\n\nMashreq Bank, where she has a secured business loan, offered her a three-month payment holiday – a process she describes as quick and “pretty seamless”. Interest will still accrue during this period, but will be charged on the final payments. “Of course it would be great if they didn’t charge the interest at all, but I think it’s fair, and it’s still a support,” says Ms Mirchandani, from Canada who lives in Dubai.\n\nRAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday. “They did their due diligence – they asked us a lot of questions, they wanted us to submit a lot documents. But they were supportive at the end, given that we could prove we had been affected," she says.\n\n“Because we are a distributor selling to retailers, it’s a no-brainer – retailers were shut across the country.”\n\nMs Mirchandani says she breathed a sigh of relief when her banks said yes. “Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest, I’m just grateful that I got it at the time that I did," she adds.\n\nBorrowers across the country have benefited from loan relief from their banks, driven by the UAE Central Bank’s Dh50 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess), part of a Dh100bn package launched on March 14. The overall size of the stimulus was later increased to Dh256bn and by April 23, banks had allocated over 60 per cent of the Dh50bn Tess package, which equates to Dh30bn.\n\nPersonal loans\n\nFor some residents, the process of applying for debt relief has been very smooth. Omar Youssef works for Orora, an events company in Dubai, which has seen most of its business dry up during Covid-19 apart from its animation studio and work on digital campaigns.\n\nHe called HSBC where he has a personal loan and is a priority banking customer and asked for a payment holiday. Due to his 33 per cent salary reduction, the bank offered him a loan holiday of up to three months, without interest or fees, though he has to sign a document each month requesting the payment holiday for an additional month and attesting his income remains reduced.\n\n“It was a very easy procedure," he says. "They send you an online form to complete and sign, and attach the company letter saying you have a salary reduction."\n\nDan Robinson, head of wealth and personal banking at HSBC UAE, said: "Our customers have told us where they need our support most and we have made those areas our focus."\n\nMr Youssef says some of his friends, who have had their incomes affected by Covid-19, did not apply for loan holidays because they thought it would be drawn-out process. “When I saw how easy it was I called my friend and told him he should do it as well," he says.\n\nMost financial relief measures are broadly similar across banks in the country, says Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of the financial comparison website Souqalmal.com. Borrowers who have been financially affected by the pandemic and the resulting movement restrictions have access to penalty-free payment holidays on loans for up to three months, and interest-free instalment plans of up to six months on grocery purchases, school fee payments and utility bill payments made with credit cards, she says.\n\n“Foreign banks have also introduced various financial relief measures, though these vary in structure and scale across individual banks,” Ms Musa adds.\n\nHome loans\n\nMortgage payments are often the biggest single cost faced by home owners and therefore relief from these can ease a significant financial burden.\n\nNatasha Hatherall-Shawe, who owns a marketing, PR and events agency in Dubai, says “overnight” the business lost around 70 per cent of its revenue, as well as facing a slowdown in client payments.\n\nNatasha Hatherall-Shawe, founder of a marketing, PR and events agency, secured relief on her mortgage after her business lost around 70 per cent of its revenue during Covid-19. Anna Nielsen / The National\n\n“It leaves our company cash flow in a very difficult place and I have 20 staff to pay and my priority is to make sure they are paid and OK," says the Briton, who lives in Dubai. "All of my savings and personal money will go into filling the gap left from reduced revenue and clients not paying."\n\nShe received a one-month holiday on her home mortgage with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, though interest will continue to accrue. She was advised by her bank that the remaining loan tenure may increase as an effect of the deferment, while service fees for the request were waived.\n\nMs Hatherall-Shawe says her bank has been responsive and helpful. "I was disappointed at one month initially, but they [then said] that they did offer up more potentially if I met the criteria," she says. "Given the nature of my business and the fact we are unlikely to get anywhere back to normal until September onwards, I am likely to apply.”\n\nThe process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straight forward, according to Arran Summerhill, director of Holo, a mortgage broker in Dubai. Banks typically want to receive an email detailing how the coronavirus has affected a borrower economically, including evidence such as a salary reduction letter, he says.\n\n“We’ve tried with six different banks now. We’ve not had a bank that has come back and actually declined a client’s request,” he says.\n\nClients that have been able to secure deferments include a landlord with multiple units, who was able to receive a loan holiday from the bank partly because his tenants were telling him they were struggling to meet monthly rent payments.\n\nMortgage broker Arran Summerhill says the process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straightforward. Pawan Singh / The National\n\nMr Summerhill, says the impact of a job loss or salary reduction will often be greater on a household than a landlord, who can be expected to have multiple revenue streams.\n\n“We’ve had households who reached out to their lenders and they seem to be very grateful for the fact it’s been a fairly smooth process for the banks to agree these payment delays,” he says.\n\nHaresh Lalwani, managing director at Right Move Mortgage Broker, believes it’s logical for banks to try to provide relief for borrowers at this time and says it is positive for a brand if a lender is proactive.\n\n“People remember which bank supported them during the tough times," he says. "So definitely, it’s a huge plus for them.”\n\nMr Lalwani benefited himself from a rent relief when his landlord, Sultan bin Ali Al Owais Real Estate. announced a 45-day rent waiver for its tenants at the end of March.\n\nCredit cards\n\nWhile relief on rents or loans is commonplace, the situation for credit card debt is also more variable, with some banks offering repayment holidays and others not.\n\nMs Musa says some banks are offering credit card customers the option to postpone their repayments by one month, with deferred interest, while other banks have also reduced their late payment fees on credit cards.\n\nCardholders may also be able to benefit from 0 per cent interest deals on balance transfers, she says. “Some banks are offering this interest-free deal for up to 12 months, making it a great way for cardholders to repay and settle their outstanding credit card debt faster," she adds.\n\nCommercial Bank of Dubai (CBD) is offering a one-month payment holiday for all customers on credit cards and other loans. Customers affected by Covid-19 can also defer their instalments for up to three months.\n\nSo far CBD has helped 3,000 customers in the UAE, says Amit Malhotra, general manager, personal banking group. “We are one of the lead banks in the Dubai banks combined relief measures package offer, and we have also undertaken several other initiatives to support our customers during the current coronavirus pandemic,” he says.\n\nMashreq is also offering a payment holiday of up to three months with no extra fees or charges to “a sizeable number” of the bank’s credit card, home loan and personal loan customers, though current interest rates apply. The banks says it reaching out to these customers directly.\n\nNot all debtors can secure relief from the banks, however. Borrowers who already defaulted on their loans before the crisis are not eligible for financial relief measures such as repayment holidays, despite the financial effects of the crisis worsening their situation, says Ms Musa. Non-residents do not qualify for relief either.\n\n“It is best for such borrowers to approach their bank to see what debt relief options are available to them, and whether the bank can restructure their debts to make repayments more manageable,” she adds.</td>

"All of my savings and personal money will go into filling the gap left from reduced revenue and clients not paying."\n\nShe received a one-month holiday on her home mortgage with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, though interest will continue to accrue. She was advised by her bank that the remaining loan tenure may increase as an effect of the deferment, while service fees for the request were waived.\n\nMs Hatherall-Shawe says her bank has been responsive and helpful. "I was disappointed at one month initially, but they [then said] that they did offer up more potentially if I met the criteria," she says. "Given the nature of my business and the fact we are unlikely to get anywhere back to normal until September onwards, I am likely to apply.”\n\nThe process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straight forward, according to Arran Summerhill, director of Holo, a mortgage broker in Dubai. Banks typically want to receive an email detailing how the coronavirus has affected a borrower economically, including evidence such as a salary reduction letter, he says.\n\n“We’ve tried with six different banks now. We’ve not had a bank that has come back and actually declined a client’s request,” he says.\n\nClients that have been able to secure deferments include a landlord with multiple units, who was able to receive a loan holiday from the bank partly because his tenants were telling him they were struggling to meet monthly rent payments.\n\nMortgage broker Arran Summerhill says the process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straightforward. Pawan Singh / The National\n\nMr Summerhill, says the impact of a job loss or salary reduction will often be greater on a household than a landlord, who can be expected to have multiple revenue streams.\n\n“We’ve had households who reached out to their lenders and they seem to be very grateful for the fact it’s been a fairly smooth process for the banks to agree these payment delays,” he says.\n\nHaresh Lalwani, managing director at Right Move Mortgage Broker, believes it’s logical for banks to try to provide relief for borrowers at this time and says it is positive for a brand if a lender is proactive.\n\n“People remember which bank supported them during the tough times," he says. "So definitely, it’s a huge plus for them.”\n\nMr Lalwani benefited himself from a rent relief when his landlord, Sultan bin Ali Al Owais Real Estate. announced a 45-day rent waiver for its tenants at the end of March.\n\nCredit cards\n\nWhile relief on rents or loans is commonplace, the situation for credit card debt is also more variable, with some banks offering repayment holidays and others not.\n\nMs Musa says some banks are offering credit card customers the option to postpone their repayments by one month, with deferred interest, while other banks have also reduced their late payment fees on credit cards.\n\nCardholders may also be able to benefit from 0 per cent interest deals on balance transfers, she says. “Some banks are offering this interest-free deal for up to 12 months, making it a great way for cardholders to repay and settle their outstanding credit card debt faster," she adds.\n\nCommercial Bank of Dubai (CBD) is offering a one-month payment holiday for all customers on credit cards and other loans. Customers affected by Covid-19 can also defer their instalments for up to three months.\n\nSo far CBD has helped 3,000 customers in the UAE, says Amit Malhotra, general manager, personal banking group. “We are one of the lead banks in the Dubai banks combined relief measures package offer, and we have also undertaken several other initiatives to support our customers during the current coronavirus pandemic,” he says.\n\nMashreq is also offering a payment holiday of up to three months with no extra fees or charges to “a sizeable number” of the bank’s credit card, home loan and personal loan customers, though current interest rates apply. The banks says it reaching out to these customers directly.\n\nNot all debtors can secure relief from the banks, however. Borrowers who already defaulted on their loans before the crisis are not eligible for financial relief measures such as repayment holidays, despite the financial effects of the crisis worsening their situation, says Ms Musa. Non-residents do not qualify for relief either.\n\n“It is best for such borrowers to approach their bank to see what debt relief options are available to them, and whether the bank can restructure their debts to make repayments more manageable,” she adds.</td>

      <td>Are there any safe havens in this global market crash?</td>
      <td>As stock market volatility looks set to continue for some time, investors can be forgiven for wanting to flee the carnage and hide their money in the safest possible haven.\n\nIn chaotic times like these, traditional stores of value such as bonds, gold and cash often come into their own, by shielding investors from the worst of the meltdown.\n\nHowever, both gold and bonds have performed erratically in recent weeks, while returns on cash are plunging even lower, amid a flurry of global interest rate cuts.\n\nBefore the coronavirus crisis struck, some cryptocurrency fans argued that Bitcoin also offers protection, but it has subsequently fallen even faster than shares.\n\nSo which of these safe havens, if any, should you be racing to right now?\n\nGovernment bonds\n\nUS government bonds, or Treasuries, are one of the lowest-risk investments in the world.\n\nThey are issued by the US Department of the Treasury to finance government spending, and it pledges to raise money by any means legally available to repay them. No wonder investors rush to buy them in a crisis.\n\nAfter wild swings in March, US Treasuries have now justified their safe haven status again. Michael Bolliger, UBS Global Wealth Management\n\nMichael Bolliger, analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, says US Treasuries also benefit from being issued in the world's reserve currency.\n\nDespite these advantages, bonds were incredibly volatile in March. While prices initially went up as stock markets fell, they then fell as panicky traders dumped long-term bonds because they anticipated a surge in the supply of newly issued debt, which would drive down prices.\n\nBond traders later calmed down after the Senate approved a massive $2 trillion (Dh7.34tn) economic relief package. “After wild swings in March, US Treasuries have now justified their safe haven status again,” Mr Bolliger says.\n\nWhen bonds are in demand, prices rise, but yields fall. On Friday, the yield on a 10-year US Treasury fell to just 0.59 per cent. If you invest in a 30-year Treasury, you get only slightly more at 1.23 per cent.\n\nUS Treasuries are safe, but you pay a high price for that kind of security these days.\n\nTo get exposure, USD Treasury Bond UCITS ETF (VDTY), which invests 100 per cent in US Treasuries, currently yields 2.06 per cent. It boasts an impressive year-to-date return of 8.91 per cent, or 14.69 per cent over 12 months, according to Bloomberg.\n\nGold\n\nGold is the oldest store of value but its price also fell in March, as fund managers took profits and used the money to cover losses elsewhere, meet customer redemptions or buy shares at reduced prices.\n\nThe gold price is nonetheless up a punchy 26.74 per cent over the last year, according to Goldprice.org. Carsten Menke, head of next generation research at Julius Baer, says its safe haven status holds good. “As the global recession unfolds, we still see more upside for gold,” he adds.\n\nGold is still some way off its all-time high price of $1,895 per ounce, which it hit during the eurozone crisis in September 2011.\n\nAt the time of writing, it trades at $1,618, and Mr Menke says it will only top its previous record if the crisis “moves out of hand and the expected short and sharp recession turns into a longer-lasting depression”.\n\nProfessor Stephen Thomas, associate dean, MBA Programmes at Cass Business School in Dubai and London, says gold has enjoyed a fantastic 12 months, along with US bonds, proving the importance of having a diversified portfolio. “The gold price certainly isn't going to collapse in the current environment, when shares are impossible to value.”\n\nThe danger comes when markets recover, as the gold price could slip back, but there seems little danger of that right now.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to invest in gold is through an exchange traded fund. WisdomTree Physical Gold (PHAU) is up 6.07 per cent so far in 2020 and 24.74 per cent over 12 months, according to Bloomberg, while iShares Physical Gold (SGLN) is up 14.35 per cent and 34.20 per cent over the same period.\n\nCash\n\nCash has been out of favour since interest rates were slashed to near zero during the global financial crisis of 2008.\n\nLast month, the US Federal Reserve cut its already-low benchmark interest rate to zero in repsonse to the current crisis, but Mr Thomas says that is the least of people's worries right now. “Cash has been underappreciated for too long. In today's low inflation world, it might be a hidden gem in your portfolio,” he adds.\n\nCash is safe but just remember that it will not completely protect your capital, as inflation may erode its value in real terms.\n\nMr Bolliger at UBS says in the longer run, you need your money to work harder than it will sitting in cash. “Money markets yield little to nothing, and even with inflation rates rather low, cash holdings offer negative real expected returns.”\n\nHowever, amid today’s extreme volatility, many investors will still appreciate the comfort that cash offers.\n\nTo get exposure, a search on comparison site Souqalmal.com shows HSBC eSaver pays up to 1.5 per cent in interest, Emirates Smart Saver Account pays 1.5 per cent, RAKBank Fast Saver pays 1.75 per cent and ADCB Active Saver Account up to 2 per cent. The interest rate you receive depends on factors such as how much you save and in which currency.\n\nBitcoin\n\nBefore Covid-19, fans of cryptocurrencies started to circulate the theory that Bitcoin was now a safe bolthole in a crisis. The last month has proved them wrong.\n\nOn February 12, Bitcoin traded at $10,350. Exactly one month later, as coronavirus swept the West, its price had slumped to $4,857 as panicky investors fled risky assets in a rush to raise cash ahead of an expected liquidity crunch. It has recovered slightly to $6,720, but as Vijay Valecha, chief investment officer at Century Financial, notes: “Bitcoin has actually been the biggest loser in this crash, falling 70 per cent as traders and investors shifted into cash.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency is a speculative and highly volatile investment, making it a poor safe haven, Mr Valecha says. “Bitcoin may be more erratic than ever amid the current volatility.”\n\nMr Bolliger says: “We do not consider Bitcoin as an investment vehicle, and would recommend investors not to see cryptocurrencies as a safe haven asset.”\n\nStay diversified\n\nAs bonds and gold have both demonstrated, even safer asset classes can fall, but Mr Valecha says their recent minor correction may be healthy because both were in danger of becoming too expensive. They now look more attractive at today's slightly lower price.\n\nMaurice Gravier, chief investment officer at Emirates NBD, says whatever happens in the stock market, one thing never changes: “The absolute golden rule in investment is diversification.”\n\nEvery investor should build a balanced portfolio that includes shares, bonds, gold, property and cash. So if one asset plunges, the others may compensate by holding firm or rising.\n\nThe balance you hold will reflect personal factors such as your age, and attitude to risk.\n\nMr Gravier says even safe havens can crumble if investors rush into cash to reduce or cover their losses. “This extreme correlation is generally temporary, so if anything it can be an opportunity,” he says.\n\nAlong with diversification, time is your best defence. Whether buying risky assets like shares, or safer options such as bonds and gold, you should aim to hold for the long term. "Avoid being a forced seller at the worst possible time, and having to take your losses," says Mr Gravier.\n\nPanic episodes like this one are a good opportunity to buy assets you are underexposed to, he says.\n\nCurrently, he is neutral on gold, relatively overweight in cash and underweight in bonds. “We are always ready to adjust,” Mr Gravier adds.</td>
