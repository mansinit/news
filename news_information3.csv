According to data gathered by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK), the first-quarter profit of the banking sector in general increased by 26.2% compared to the same period of 2019, reaching TL 15.7 billion ($2.27 billion).

The profit of public banks, namely Ziraat, Halkbank and Vakıfbank, increased by 111.3%, reaching TL 4.4 billion. Over this period, the profit of foreign banks in the country increased by 0.7% to reach TL 4.1 billion, while the domestic private banks’ profit increased by 9% to TL 4.9 billion.

Ziraat Bank, presiding over a profit of TL 1.8 billion following a 70% increase in the first quarter, became the sector leader in terms of profitability. Halkbank increased its profit by 170% to TL 825.1 million, while Vakıfbank increased by 163% to TL 1.7 billion.

The interest rate cuts and a decrease in funding costs reflected positively on the state bank's profitability too, which initially stepped up for credit expansion. Meanwhile, within the same period, the profit of private banks, Garanti Bank, Akbank, Yapı Kredi and İş Bank also decreased.

The capital of Halkbank and Vakıfbank will be boosted by TL 7 billion each via private placement, according to stock exchange filings made by state-owned banks.

The financing of the capital increase will be covered by the cash obtained from the sale of domestic debt securities issued by the treasury to banks, the fund said.

3,Daily Sabah,Ziraat Bank,2020-04-19,Turkey's banking watchdog announces new asset ratio to boost lending,"Turkey’s banking watchdog announced Saturday new regulations to push private banks to give more credit and purchase government bonds to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.

According to a statement released by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK), banks are required to maintain a new consolidated and individual asset ratio of at least 100% starting at the beginning of next month; otherwise, they will have to pay an administration fee. The ratio will be calculated by banks and will be reviewed weekly by the BDDK, the statement said.

The sum of a bank’s loans, 75% of its securities portfolio and 50% of its central bank swap balances must exceed the sum of its Turkish lira deposits and 125% of foreign currency deposits, according to the new regulation. For participation banks, which follow Islamic banking regulations, the loans, securities and swaps should equal at least 80% of the deposits.

BDDK Chairman Mehmet Ali Akben said the move would address difficulties that he said the real sector faced when accessing credit as the economy is hit by the impact of shutdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.

“The primary duty of the banks is to transfer deposits collected from our citizens and companies to the real economy by giving credit,” Akben told state-owned Anadolu Agency (AA).

“However, we have seen that some banks prefer to direct their resources to money markets and foreign derivatives markets instead of performing this basic function.”

Akben said the regulator had told banks last month to make sure demands for loans were met and restrictions on credit eased. “In the past three weeks, we found that there were banks that did not comply with this recommendation,” he said.

The BDDK chairman noted that new regulations aim to enable the credit system to operate effectively, protect the interests of savers and support the development and stability of financial markets, adding that the watchdog could set new regulations and measures to respond to virus-induced banking problems.

He stated that banks that consider the financial wellbeing of their customers during the pandemic will increase their medium to long-term profitably by solidifying customer loyalty.

Government urges private banks to do more to mitigate impact

Last week, Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak called on private banks to do more to help customers hurt by the economic impact of the coronavirus, saying that state-owned banks had offered delays in repayments for loans.

“While our state banks are standing by our citizens with all the resources they have, we are utterly saddened by the attitude of the privately held banks,” Albayrak said.

“I, once again, invite private banks to be a part of our unity and solidarity during these times with their attitude,” he added.

He noted that public lenders Ziraat Bank, Halkbank and VakıfBank, have already allowed commercial and corporate enterprises to delay credit payments worth TL 20.5 billion ($3 billion).

The three banks said in separate statements that they will provide long-term postponements of up to 12 months for some sectors affected by the outbreak the most, such as tourism and public transportation. Firms will also be given an extra credit limit for easing their check payments and operation costs.

Participation banks have also moved to ease the process to minimize the potential damage to economic life.

The state-run participation bank, Ziraat Katılım, announced that upon the request of their commercial and retail customers, the installment, dividend and principal payments due on March 31 will be postponed.

One of the country's leading participation banks, Vakıf Katılım, will also provide flexibility in installment payments until June 30, upon the demands of customers using individual and corporate funds.

Meanwhile, funding specific to the hardest-hit sectors, including tourism and urban public transport, will be restructured for up to 12 months of a payment-free period.","Turkey’s banking watchdog announced Saturday new regulations to push private banks to give more credit and purchase government bonds to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.

The bill was prepared by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and includes a series of measures aimed at cushioning the economic fallout of the pandemic.

Informing the members of Parliament's Planning and Budget Commission during the talks on the bill, TWF General Manager Zafer Sönmez said the main aim was to provide a solution to strategic and large-scale companies facing capital and cash problems due to the outbreak.

Sönmez was cited by the Turkish daily Dünya as saying that the new regulation would also prevent capital outflow from the companies.

The bill paves the way for the TWF to inject cash or acquire controlling stakes in strategic firms, and exempts the wealth fund from certain corporate regulations governing its investments in private companies.

In the post-coronavirus world, Sönmez said they anticipate that the public will increase its impact in both capital and borrowing areas, and that they aim to support companies that face financial difficulties and a lack of capital, strengthening their capital and preventing the capital outflow.

Within the scope of TL 10,000 support for basic needs, some TL 12.1 billion has been allocated to around 2.1 million citizens, Albayrak said.

Around 412,714 applications were made for public lender Halkbank’s TL 25,000 support package, and processes were completed for 206,959, the minister noted. He added that resources allocated for tradesmen reached nearly TL 6.74 billion.

Within the scope of TL 1,000 cash aid under the scope of relief package, nearly 2.1 million families have so far received the support, Albayrak said, adding that this figure will reach 4.4 million soon.

The minister on Sunday said the country postponed TL 40.6 billion worth of housing, consumer, vehicle and credit card loans for a total of 795,000 citizens.

Public lenders, Ziraat Bank, Halkbank and VakıfBank, have allowed commercial and corporate enterprises to delay credit payments worth TL 20.5 billion.

In a video posted on his Twitter account, Albayrak has also said the public banks, Ziraat Bank, Halkbank and VakıfBank, had allowed commercial and corporate enterprises to delay credit payments worth TL 20.5 billion.

Meanwhile, he called on private banks to do more to help customers hurt by the economic impact of the coronavirus, saying that state-owned banks had offered delays in repayments for loans.

“While our state banks are standing by our citizens with all the resources they have, we are utterly saddened by the attitude of the privately held banks,” Albayrak said.

“I, once again, invite private banks to be a part of our unity and solidarity during these times with their attitude,” he added.

The country last month introduced a TL 100 billion stimulus package – the Economic Stability Shield – to safeguard individuals and firms against the economic fallout of the pandemic. The government has introduced financial support for families with low income, launched a donation campaign and also offered state-guaranteed loans for companies and small businesses.

Albayrak said in the video that 290,000 tradesmen had applied for TL 25,000 in support financing, noting that the processing of 163,450 applications had been completed and that nearly TL 4.1 billion's worth of financing had been allocated.

“More than 4.2 million citizens have applied for the individual support package. Over TL 1.5 billion has been allocated to over 250,000 of our citizens,” Albayrak said.

As of Friday, Albayrak said 66,171 companies had applied for ""Support to Continue Working"" financing backed by the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF) on the condition that they retain employees.

“The processing of 34,858 companies has been concluded and the financing of TL 29.558 billion has been allocated. Our SMEs constitute 96% of the firms to whom the financing was allocated,” Albayrak stressed.

7,Daily Sabah,Ziraat Bank,2020-04-01,Turkey shows solidarity at home and abroad against coronavirus,"Turkey's role as a leading humanitarian actor on the world stage has once more prevailed. The country, meanwhile, continues to set an example of national solidarity with a fundraising campaign consistently gaining momentum. The country is embattled with an outbreak, with new cases announced every day, while authorities call for compliance with social distancing measures.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Wednesday the country may stop the virus from spreading faster by keeping social activities to a minimum and adhering to social distancing. “I ask our nation to not leave home as long as possible until these difficult days are over,” he said, in a speech before a videoconference with provincial chairs of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party).

“We have to comply with measures advised by scientists and imposed by the government. If each citizen keeps himself or herself in voluntary quarantine, we will not need further measures,” Erdoğan said, implying there won't be a full lockdown like in other countries. ""If people do not comply with advice to stay home, do not adhere to social distancing or do not care about cleaning and if the outbreak spreads, stricter measures will be inevitable,"" he warned. Erdoğan pointed out restrictions on intercity travel by bus and said there may be similar restrictions for innercity travel if the need arises.

He also called on all members of the AK Party to join the “We are Self-Sufficient” campaign he had announced earlier.

A Turkish military cargo plane loaded with medical equipment arrived in Spain on Wednesday. The plane, which will deliver the aid first to Spain, will stop in Italy to provide assistance on its return.

The plane took off from Etimesgut military airport in the capital Ankara carrying crates full of masks, hazmat suits, goggles and disinfectants. All equipment on board has been produced at military-owned factories and at sewing workshops that produce military uniforms and other clothing for the army. The crates containing the supplies carry messages reading: “With love to the people of Spain and Italy, from Turkey” and the words of the 13th-century Sufi mystic Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi: ""There is hope after despair and many suns after darkness.""

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg praised Turkey's efforts, tweeting that it was “NATO solidarity in action.” “Proud to see NATO allies supporting each other through our disaster relief center,"" Stoltenberg tweeted with the hashtag #StrongerTogether.

""Turkey stands together with its allies in times of crisis and hardship. We hope our allies do the same,"" Presidential Spokesman İbrahim Kalın tweeted in response to Stoltenberg.

""We are in the middle of a turning point in history, living through a paradigm shift moment. This ordeal will either bring us closer to one another or turn us into further strangers in an increasingly uncertain and fragile world. The choice is ours,"" Kalın also tweeted.

The Italian delegation in NATO also took to Twitter to thank Turkey. ""Following Italy's activation of NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Center, today, our ally Turkey is set to deliver critical medical equipment to Italy. Deeply grateful to our Turkish friends for their solidarity!"" said the delegation.

The Spanish delegation to NATO also expressed gratefulness to Turkey via their official Twitter account. ""After Spain's request to NATO's EADRCC, a new supply to fight COVID-19 arrives from our ally Turkey,"" it said, referring to the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC).

Erdoğan announced the aid Monday and said the country had already sent a shipload of medical supplies via the Turkish Red Crescent to Italy. “The stronger Turkey gets, the longer it can extend its helping hand to its allies,” he said. Turkey first sent medical equipment to China, the epicenter of the virus outbreak, in February, when it sent a military cargo plane to evacuate its citizens in China's Wuhan. When Turkey's eastern neighbor Iran started reporting a barrage of coronavirus cases, the country donated 1,000 test kits.

The coronavirus pandemic has killed over 30,000 people in Europe, with more than three-quarters of the deaths registered in Italy and Spain, according to an Agence France-Presse (AFP) tally Wednesday citing official figures. The most deaths were recorded in Italy, with 12,428 fatalities, followed by Spain with 8,189 and France with 3,523. Turkey has so far recorded 214 deaths and 13,531 cases.

Nation united for aid

Meanwhile, a fundraising campaign launched by the presidency to help those affected by the coronavirus outbreak substantially grew in two days. After Erdoğan announced the launch on Monday, people from all walks of life across the country rushed to contribute. At least TL 240 million ($35.95 million) was donated to the campaign, which began with Erdoğan himself donating his salary for the equivalent of seven months. Top public lenders Ziraat and Vakıfbank announced a donation of more than TL 11 million on Tuesday and Wednesday, while major telecom provider Türk Telekom contributed TL 40 million. Supreme Court President Mehmet Akarca also announced Wednesday that he had asked every judge and prosecutor to donate at least TL 1,000 for the campaign. Stock exchange Borsa İstanbul announced a contribution of TL 5 million.

Muzaffer Gülşen, 94, has already made a sacrifice for her country. Gülşen is the famed mother of two men and mother-in-law of another who lost their lives while trying to block an attack by putschists during the July 15, 2016 coup attempt. Nevertheless, she also insisted on donating to the campaign. The elderly woman, who cannot leave home due to a curfew imposed on senior citizens vulnerable to the outbreak, called officials to her home and gave them her debit card, telling them to withdraw her pension payment for the month to donate to the campaign.

Children across the country have also fiercely supported the campaign. Esin Afra Karaca, 9, emptied her piggy bank and offered TL 60 she had saved to her father, telling him to donate it. “I saw the president speaking about the campaign and decided to join. I gave the money to my father, and he was very happy. Everyone should be doing something for the country,” Karaca told Anadolu Agency (AA) Wednesday.

Meanwhile, third-grader Öykü Ada Doğan of Istanbul had been collecting money to buy a piano, but she shelved her plans to contribute to the campaign. Doğan, an ardent lover of all things musical, is attending piano classes and has been dreaming of buying a piano, having begun saving six months ago. “When I heard the campaign and heard that people were having problems due to lack of work, I wanted to help out,” Doğan, who donated TL 875 to the campaign, told AA. “I'm happier to help people. It is more important (than having a piano),” she said.

More support to citizens

""With the help of our imams, police officers, gendarmerie, teachers and every type of civil servant, we were able to visit the homes of 725,000 elderly people and met whatever needs they had,"" Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu said in a televised interview late Tuesday.

Soylu was referring to the Vefa social support groups formed across the country's 81 provinces, which are tasked with reaching out to the elderly, delivering them aid or helping with household chores.

The government has already started a scheme offering an additional payment of TL 1,000 for the needy families, while public lenders are providing a loan of TL 10,000 with repayments delayed for six months. Pensions have also been delivered in advance to millions.

Some 2 million households will also benefit from a boost of TL 1,000 in support launched Wednesday.

Quarantine ends for some

Turkey has also started discharging people from their quarantine spaces. After completing their 14-day period of isolation, those who tested negative were allowed to leave their dormitories of residence, while those testing positive have been since hospitalized. Turkey has arranged flights to evacuate thousands from abroad, while those returning by their own means have been placed under quarantine. At least 11,000 people have been quarantined since early March.

In northwestern Turkey's Kocaeli, those who arrived from Germany and other European countries last month were released from dormitories on Wednesday. Ali Kemal Zengin, who was placed in quarantine after arriving from Germany, spoke about his days in quarantine after leaving the dormitory. “I made new friends here, and the state took good care of everyone. We enjoyed good meals and were treated well. I heard some rumors on social media that conditions were bad. It is all lies. It was a really good place, and I am grateful to the state,” he told AA.","The country, meanwhile, continues to set an example of national solidarity with a fundraising campaign consistently gaining momentum.

8,Daily Sabah,Ziraat Bank,2020-03-26,"Turkish lenders' financial stimulus to create vital resources for firms, protect employment","A financial stimulus package announced by public lenders on Wednesday, in line with government measures to cushion the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, will provide vital resources for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and will be instrumental in maintaining the current employment rate, according to business representatives.

Three conventional banks – Ziraat, Halkbank and VakıfBank – and two participation lenders – Ziraat Katılım and Vakıf Katılım – announced their packages, available to all enterprises that are feeling the pinch from the outbreak. To qualify for support, companies cannot cut their number of registered employees from the end of February.

The package will provide a 36-month loan, with 7.5% annual interest and a six-month non-payment period. Banks will accept credit applications for up to TL 100 million (around $15.5 million).

The move follows a TL 100 billion (around $15.4 billion) relief package announced by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan last week that included dozens of measures to help citizens, companies, businesses and institutions that might feel the economic impact from the outbreak.

Turkey’s death toll from the coronavirus increased by 15 to 59 on Wednesday, as the number of confirmed cases rose by 561 to 2,433, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said.

To contain the virus, Ankara has taken a series of measures to contain the virus, including limiting the use of public spaces and imposing a curfew on the elderly, as well as closing schools, cafes and bars, banning mass prayers and suspending sports matches and flights.

Erdoğan said Wednesday that Turkey, which has a population of about 83 million, would overcome the coronavirus outbreak in two to three weeks.

Vital resources

Employment and production should be maintained to prevent the economy from suffering greater loss, said Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (İTO) chairman Şekib Avdagiç, who also praised the stimulus announced by the public lenders.

“A vital resource will be created, especially for SMEs. Plus, employment protection being one of the criteria is extremely important,” Avdagiç noted. He also underlined the importance of maximizing the number of companies to benefit from the package.

“The success of the support will be determined by the spread of the loan to the base,” he continued. “The more SMEs benefit from this loan support, the more impact it will have. The more companies this resource reaches, the faster the wheels will spin.”

Indicating that each of these steps serves as a link of the chain, Avdagiç pointed out that short working allowances, postponement of loan payments and cost-effective financing announced by the government and banks “will make a contribution to the compensation of this process.”

Under the TL 100 billion package announced by Erdoğan, the country postponed debt payments and reduced the tax burden on some sectors.

Debt repayments of companies affected by the coronavirus were postponed for a minimum of three months, while value-added taxes (VAT) and social security payments for various sectors were also deferred.

VAT for domestic aviation was cut to 1% from 18% and the limit of the treasury-backed credit guarantee fund, which guarantees loans to small and medium-sized businesses, would be doubled to TL 50 billion ($7.7 billion).

Separately, the country’s public and private lenders earlier this week announced support packages for their customers to soften the impact of the outbreak.

They have offered some flexible loan payment options for customers and corporate debt restructuring, especially for the badly hit tourism and transportation sectors.

The president also called on banks not to restrict loans and for companies not to cut jobs.

Avdagiç noted that the loan packages, together with other financial measures taken to combat the economic fallout from coronavirus, would complement each other.

Nail Olpak, chairman of the Foreign Economic Relations Board (DEİK), highlighted the significance of the package, stressing that regardless of any sectoral distinction, it will be extremely useful for all firms that are economically affected by the outbreak to receive a loan.

""It will boost our businesses, especially our SMEs,” Olpak said.

Morale boost for the business world

Efforts by the government and the banks have given a morale boost to the business world, said Turkish Exporters’ Assembly (TİM) Chairman İsmail Gülle, who remarked that support offered by the lenders, especially the Export Credit Bank of Turkey (Türk Eximbank), would also significantly contribute to the country’s exporters and the business world.

Türk Eximbank introduced a support package for exporters on Tuesday in a move to alleviate financial difficulties caused by falling demand for exports amid the outbreak.

In a statement, the bank said it extended credit repayment terms by three to six months depending on exporter demand and the commitment closure term by a year, prolonged re-discount credit terms to two years, and eased insurance terms. The moves aim to help exporters continue production and maintain employment as they see orders falling or being canceled due to virus fears.

Gülle praised measures announced by the Industry and Technology Ministry, which looks to boost local production of medical equipment and provide short-term working allowances, and the Family, Labor and Social Services Ministry, which aims to modify compensatory working time, as important developments for the business world.

Abdurrahman Kaan, chairman of the Independent Industrialists and Businessmen Association (MÜSİAD), said for Turkey, one of the biggest concerns of this outbreak, which is expected to create a new world order from the economic chaos, is the probable loss of employment that may occur in parallel with the job loss of the enterprises.

“As an organization that prioritizes not only making money but also the interests of our country and the well-being of our country since the day we were founded, we will do our best to prevent any negative development in our businesses operating under the roof of MÜSİAD and therefore call on our business community to continue employment with regards to no loss of employment in our organization,” Kaan said. “In this context, we believe that the postponement of concise tax withholding and value-added taxes (VAT) and insurance premium payments provided to our employers within the scope of the Economic Stability Shield package, minimum wage support of up to TL 7 billion ($1.1 billion) in total, and other benefits provided regarding flexible working conditions and compensatory working time will be instrumental in maintaining the current employment rate.”","To qualify for support, companies cannot cut their number of registered employees from the end of February.
The package will provide a 36-month loan, with 7.5% annual interest and a six-month non-payment period.
“The more SMEs benefit from this loan support, the more impact it will have.
Separately, the country’s public and private lenders earlier this week announced support packages for their customers to soften the impact of the outbreak.
Türk Eximbank introduced a support package for exporters on Tuesday in a move to alleviate financial difficulties caused by falling demand for exports amid the outbreak.",resources announced stimulus billion support package economic employment financial vital create turkish protect working lenders companies business firms loan,"A financial stimulus package announced by public lenders on Wednesday, in line with government measures to cushion the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, will provide vital resources for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and will be instrumental in maintaining the current employment rate, according to business representatives.

Three conventional banks – Ziraat, Halkbank and VakıfBank – and two participation lenders – Ziraat Katılım and Vakıf Katılım – announced their packages, available to all enterprises that are feeling the pinch from the outbreak. To qualify for support, companies cannot cut their number of registered employees from the end of February.

The package will provide a 36-month loan, with 7.5% annual interest and a six-month non-payment period. Banks will accept credit applications for up to TL 100 million (around $15.5 million).

The move follows a TL 100 billion (around $15.4 billion) relief package announced by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan last week that included dozens of measures to help citizens, companies, businesses and institutions that might feel the economic impact from the outbreak.

Turkey’s death toll from the coronavirus increased by 15 to 59 on Wednesday, as the number of confirmed cases rose by 561 to 2,433, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said.

To contain the virus, Ankara has taken a series of measures to contain the virus, including limiting the use of public spaces and imposing a curfew on the elderly, as well as closing schools, cafes and bars, banning mass prayers and suspending sports matches and flights.

Erdoğan said Wednesday that Turkey, which has a population of about 83 million, would overcome the coronavirus outbreak in two to three weeks.

Vital resources

Employment and production should be maintained to prevent the economy from suffering greater loss, said Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (İTO) chairman Şekib Avdagiç, who also praised the stimulus announced by the public lenders.

“A vital resource will be created, especially for SMEs. Plus, employment protection being one of the criteria is extremely important,” Avdagiç noted. He also underlined the importance of maximizing the number of companies to benefit from the package.

“The success of the support will be determined by the spread of the loan to the base,” he continued. “The more SMEs benefit from this loan support, the more impact it will have. The more companies this resource reaches, the faster the wheels will spin.”

Indicating that each of these steps serves as a link of the chain, Avdagiç pointed out that short working allowances, postponement of loan payments and cost-effective financing announced by the government and banks “will make a contribution to the compensation of this process.”

Under the TL 100 billion package announced by Erdoğan, the country postponed debt payments and reduced the tax burden on some sectors.

Debt repayments of companies affected by the coronavirus were postponed for a minimum of three months, while value-added taxes (VAT) and social security payments for various sectors were also deferred.

VAT for domestic aviation was cut to 1% from 18% and the limit of the treasury-backed credit guarantee fund, which guarantees loans to small and medium-sized businesses, would be doubled to TL 50 billion ($7.7 billion).

Separately, the country’s public and private lenders earlier this week announced support packages for their customers to soften the impact of the outbreak.

They have offered some flexible loan payment options for customers and corporate debt restructuring, especially for the badly hit tourism and transportation sectors.

The president also called on banks not to restrict loans and for companies not to cut jobs.

Avdagiç noted that the loan packages, together with other financial measures taken to combat the economic fallout from coronavirus, would complement each other.

Nail Olpak, chairman of the Foreign Economic Relations Board (DEİK), highlighted the significance of the package, stressing that regardless of any sectoral distinction, it will be extremely useful for all firms that are economically affected by the outbreak to receive a loan.

""It will boost our businesses, especially our SMEs,” Olpak said.

Morale boost for the business world

Efforts by the government and the banks have given a morale boost to the business world, said Turkish Exporters’ Assembly (TİM) Chairman İsmail Gülle, who remarked that support offered by the lenders, especially the Export Credit Bank of Turkey (Türk Eximbank), would also significantly contribute to the country’s exporters and the business world.

Türk Eximbank introduced a support package for exporters on Tuesday in a move to alleviate financial difficulties caused by falling demand for exports amid the outbreak.

In a statement, the bank said it extended credit repayment terms by three to six months depending on exporter demand and the commitment closure term by a year, prolonged re-discount credit terms to two years, and eased insurance terms. The moves aim to help exporters continue production and maintain employment as they see orders falling or being canceled due to virus fears.

Gülle praised measures announced by the Industry and Technology Ministry, which looks to boost local production of medical equipment and provide short-term working allowances, and the Family, Labor and Social Services Ministry, which aims to modify compensatory working time, as important developments for the business world.

Abdurrahman Kaan, chairman of the Independent Industrialists and Businessmen Association (MÜSİAD), said for Turkey, one of the biggest concerns of this outbreak, which is expected to create a new world order from the economic chaos, is the probable loss of employment that may occur in parallel with the job loss of the enterprises.

Under the TL 100 billion ($15.4 billion) package, Erdoğan said the country would postpone debt payments and reduce the tax burden on some sectors.

Among specific measures, he said Turkey's tourism accommodation tax was suspended until November to support the key tourism sector, which accounts for 12% of the economy.

Debt repayments of companies affected by the coronavirus will be postponed for a minimum of three months, while value-added tax and social security payments for various sectors will also be deferred.

Value-added tax for domestic aviation was cut to 1% from 18% and the limit of the treasury-backed credit guarantee fund – which guarantees loans to small- and medium-sized firms – would be doubled to TL 50 billion.

The bank said that appropriate term restructuring applications will be developed for the current financing of the customers whose cash flow was disrupted or could face disruption and may have payment problems accordingly, by providing an additional period of up to six months of a payment free period and up to 12 months for sectors with periodic activity.

Firms that pay their personnel salaries though the Ziraat Katılım will be provided with an additional limit of three months' staff salary expense, if necessary, on the condition of maintaining their employment levels the same as the end of February, the bank said in a statement.

One of the country's leading participation banks, Vakıf Katılım, will also provide flexibility in installment payments until June 30, upon the demands of customers using individual and corporate funds.

Besides, funding specific to the most affected sectors, including tourism and urban public transport, will be restructured for up to 12 months of a payment free period.

The Turkish Capital Markets Board also said Monday that it was extending the first-quarter financial reporting deadline by 30 days for companies with traded market tools in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Turkey on Sunday confirmed nine more deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, as the total number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 1,256.

Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said Sunday evening that all of the 30 people who have died from the disease were senior citizens.",public private lender turkey announce monday launch support package customer move soften economic impact coronavirus outbreak statement turkey bank allow individual corporate client postpone interest principal payment due state bank restructuring loan month additional time sector tourism sixmonth nonpayment period bank increase limit client pay wage bank amount equal month employee wage company decrease employment endoffebruary level comment bank treasury finance minister berat statement share twitter account public bank important part measure country effect coronavirus pandemic economy citizen unemployed labor market alive say private bank similar step state nation business world bad situation hand hand flexible loan repayment vakfbank announce support package give client flexibility repay loan june accord statement publish lender bank allow restructuring loan company operate tourism transportation sector coronavirus outbreak order facilitate public payment obligation company social security tax cash management limit increase payment limit threemonth nonpayment period month installment vakfbank mobile vakfbank branch operate accordance measure announce ministry health m p m transaction banking statement stateowned allow individual corporate client postpone interest principal payment due bank restructuring loan sixmonth nonpayment period month sector tourism increase limit client pay wage bank equal employee wage next month company decrease employment endoffebruary level president recep tayyip erdogan last week turkey debt payment tax burden sector package measure support economy specific measure turkey tourism accommodation tax november support key tourism sector account economy debt repayment company coronavirus postpone minimum month tax social security payment various sector valueadded tax domestic aviation cut limit credit guarantee fund guarantee loan small firm private lender bank announce stimulus package customer statement monday bank accordance customer april postponement principal interest installment payment june additional condition necessary support casebycase basis sector affect tourism mall retail sector statement small enterprise limit order able fulfill commercial obligation undertake pandemic necessary maximum effort support enterprise bank add statement accord package necessary additional limit allocate client salary payment bank customer charge electronic fund transfer wire transfer transaction digital channel card card transfer april credit card limit increase accord customer expense health food point sale payment record device fee delay month private lender allow individual corporate client postpone interest principal installment payment due april june participation bank ease process participation bank ease process potential damage economic life staterun participation bank ziraat katlm announce request commercial retail customer installment dividend principal payment due march postpone bank appropriate term application current financing customer cash flow disrupt disruption payment problem additional period month payment free period month sector periodic activity firm pay salary ziraat katlm additional limit month staff salary expense necessary condition employment level end february bank statement country participation bank vakf flexibility installment payment june demand customer individual corporate fund specific affected sector tourism urban public transport restructure month payment free period turkish capital market board monday firstquarter financial report deadline day company trade market tool response coronavirus pandemic turkey sunday death disease new coronavirus total number confirm case country health minister fahrettin sunday disease senior citizen,turkish lender join hand support business economic impact outbreak,Support,Positive
12,Daily Sabah,Ziraat Bank,2020-03-19,İlhan Berk: ‘You are free to the extent of the meaningless’,"Periodization of modern Turkish poetry has been an ongoing debate for decades. The academic syllabus accepts that modern poetry began in the Tanzimat reform period, in the mid-19th century, by innovative poets like Şinasi and Namık Kemal. On the other hand, general approval of the poetry circles depicts a picture of modern Turkish poetry beginning with the Garip (the Strange) movement of the late 1930s, which was initiated by Orhan Veli and friends. Some people even think that Garip was the “Birinci Yeni” (the First New) movement, provided “yeni” is one of the Turkish words to translate “modern.”

Both ways of periodization depend on ideological interpretations of Turkish poetry to some extent, while neither of them has anything to do with poetry aesthetics. I think one should take into consideration the differentiation between the terms “modern” and “modernism” when periodizing the last centuries of Turkish poetry. Şinasi and Kemal did something very new by adding innovative forms to the old body of poetry. However, neither the two founding fathers nor their peers and disciples could be assessed as being modernists in their aesthetic visions.

So, when did modernism start in Turkish poetry? Was Nazım Hikmet a modernist poet? Or can we put Necip Fazıl at the ground zero of the modernist movement? I suppose no one can claim that Hikmet, Fazıl or any of their peers were responsible for initiating the modernist momentum since all of them owed some part of their poetry to the tradition. The first generation – which tried to write poetry depending heavily on the actual moment rather than making innovations, renewals or shifts within the framework the tradition – was that of Veli and friends – the Garip movement, in short. Yet, the Garip was only against tradition, which didn’t exist according to Cemal Süreya, and couldn’t create convincing aesthetics of their modernism in a poetical way. The members of the Second New movement of the 1950s, on the other hand, managed to invent really modernist aesthetics that included too many experiments, some of which were done for the sake of merely experimenting and caused too many lines with ambiguity or made no sense at all. İlhan Berk and Ece Ayhan were the “uç beyi” (margraves) of the Second New. Berk was generally the most experimental of all.

Early life

Berk was born “İlhan Birsen” on Nov. 18, 1918, in Manisa province to a lower-middle-class family. His father Veli was a businessman though he was illiterate. İlhan was raised by his mother Hesna, who divorced Veli when İlhan was very young, and his older brothers, who worked at the local marketplace as grocers.

Berk graduated from the Balıkesir School for Teachers and became an elementary school teacher. However, his true ambition was poetry and he published his first volume of poetry, “Güneşi Yakanların Selamı” (Salute of Those who Burnt the Sun), carrying heavy influences of Hikmet, in 1935, when he was a still a student. He had been publishing some poems at local periodicals in Manisa including the “Yeni Doğuş” (New Birth) published by the Manisa People’s House. He worked as an elementary school teacher in the Espiye village of Giresun province before he joined the army for compulsory service. After completing his military service, he was assigned as a teacher in Edirne province.

Berk enrolled at the French department of the Gazi Teachers’ College and graduated from that school in 1944. He taught French at secondary schools in various provinces until 1955 when he began to work as a translator for Ziraat Bank, where he retired in 1969.

Blanket poems

Berk’s early poetry shows the influences of such epic poets as Hikmet, Guillaume Apollinaire and Walt Whitman. He used to write long lines, with every poem spanning pages, which he mocked in later years saying, “I used to write blanket poems in those years.” His early poetry shows his enthusiasm toward life, people and urban sights, which the volume named “Istanbul” characterizes best. He could mention anything in these poems from the lead domes of ancestral mosques to the heavy weights daily workers carried from place to place in the commercial districts of Istanbul. His poems looked like notes taken while walking through the streets of a crowded city.

Berk left the blanket form under newer influences he received from the younger poets of the Second New. He changed the form of his style in the early 1950s and became a dedicated member of the modernist movement.

“Galile Denizi” (The Sea of Galilee) was Berk’s first but triumphant book written in the Second New style. The volume included exotic, individualistic and momentary insights of any interesting aspects of Istanbul life. Ece Ayhan claims in an interview they made together with Cemal Süreya and Tomris Uyar that Berk converted to Christianity in the 1950s, but Berk denies this by saying only, “I didn’t.”

Whether or not he converted to any religious or ideological belief, Berk was so interested in the charismatic figures of religion that he wrote some of his most outstanding poems on religious figures such as Abu Hanifa, the leader of the Hanafi school of thought in the Sunni branch of Islam.

Berk also made many experiments in the text of his poetry. He even imitated Lettrism with nonsensical images of alphabetical letters. He also wrote concrete poetry by using the scatter of words on the paper as pictures.

On the other hand, Berk remained the poet of blanket poems written on cities and human figures. He liked to write cultural and intellectual poems, which prevented him from making a firm connection with the general audience. Though he was granted numerous prestigious poetry awards, he didn’t become a popular icon in the media. His name was iconized after his death.

Berk lived his last years in Bodrum before he died on Aug. 28, 2008.","Periodization of modern Turkish poetry has been an ongoing debate for decades.
