0,mashreq,29-04-2020,"As business slowed before grinding to a halt at the end of March, Payal Mirchandani, the chief executive of Pinca Trading, watched as orders and payments dried up from the large retailers that buy from her.

She slashed the annual sales forecast for her business, which distributes toys and other children's products, while fielding emails and calls from retailers that wanted to extend payment terms, from 60 to 100 days. Then she turned to her banks for relief.

Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest ... Payal Mirchandani, Pinca Trading

Mashreq Bank, where she has a secured business loan, offered her a three-month payment holiday – a process she describes as quick and “pretty seamless”. Interest will still accrue during this period, but will be charged on the final payments. “Of course it would be great if they didn’t charge the interest at all, but I think it’s fair, and it’s still a support,” says Ms Mirchandani, from Canada who lives in Dubai.

RAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday. “They did their due diligence – they asked us a lot of questions, they wanted us to submit a lot documents. But they were supportive at the end, given that we could prove we had been affected,"" she says.

“Because we are a distributor selling to retailers, it’s a no-brainer – retailers were shut across the country.”

Ms Mirchandani says she breathed a sigh of relief when her banks said yes. “Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest, I’m just grateful that I got it at the time that I did,"" she adds.

Borrowers across the country have benefited from loan relief from their banks, driven by the UAE Central Bank’s Dh50 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess), part of a Dh100bn package launched on March 14. The overall size of the stimulus was later increased to Dh256bn and by April 23, banks had allocated over 60 per cent of the Dh50bn Tess package, which equates to Dh30bn.

Personal loans

For some residents, the process of applying for debt relief has been very smooth. Omar Youssef works for Orora, an events company in Dubai, which has seen most of its business dry up during Covid-19 apart from its animation studio and work on digital campaigns.

He called HSBC where he has a personal loan and is a priority banking customer and asked for a payment holiday. Due to his 33 per cent salary reduction, the bank offered him a loan holiday of up to three months, without interest or fees, though he has to sign a document each month requesting the payment holiday for an additional month and attesting his income remains reduced.

“It was a very easy procedure,"" he says. ""They send you an online form to complete and sign, and attach the company letter saying you have a salary reduction.""

Dan Robinson, head of wealth and personal banking at HSBC UAE, said: ""Our customers have told us where they need our support most and we have made those areas our focus.""

Mr Youssef says some of his friends, who have had their incomes affected by Covid-19, did not apply for loan holidays because they thought it would be drawn-out process. “When I saw how easy it was I called my friend and told him he should do it as well,"" he says.

Most financial relief measures are broadly similar across banks in the country, says Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of the financial comparison website Souqalmal.com. Borrowers who have been financially affected by the pandemic and the resulting movement restrictions have access to penalty-free payment holidays on loans for up to three months, and interest-free instalment plans of up to six months on grocery purchases, school fee payments and utility bill payments made with credit cards, she says.

“Foreign banks have also introduced various financial relief measures, though these vary in structure and scale across individual banks,” Ms Musa adds.

Home loans

Mortgage payments are often the biggest single cost faced by home owners and therefore relief from these can ease a significant financial burden.

Natasha Hatherall-Shawe, who owns a marketing, PR and events agency in Dubai, says “overnight” the business lost around 70 per cent of its revenue, as well as facing a slowdown in client payments.

“It leaves our company cash flow in a very difficult place and I have 20 staff to pay and my priority is to make sure they are paid and OK,"" says the Briton, who lives in Dubai. ""All of my savings and personal money will go into filling the gap left from reduced revenue and clients not paying.""

She received a one-month holiday on her home mortgage with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, though interest will continue to accrue. She was advised by her bank that the remaining loan tenure may increase as an effect of the deferment, while service fees for the request were waived.

Ms Hatherall-Shawe says her bank has been responsive and helpful. ""I was disappointed at one month initially, but they [then said] that they did offer up more potentially if I met the criteria,"" she says. ""Given the nature of my business and the fact we are unlikely to get anywhere back to normal until September onwards, I am likely to apply.”

The process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straight forward, according to Arran Summerhill, director of Holo, a mortgage broker in Dubai. Banks typically want to receive an email detailing how the coronavirus has affected a borrower economically, including evidence such as a salary reduction letter, he says.

“We’ve tried with six different banks now. We’ve not had a bank that has come back and actually declined a client’s request,” he says.

Clients that have been able to secure deferments include a landlord with multiple units, who was able to receive a loan holiday from the bank partly because his tenants were telling him they were struggling to meet monthly rent payments.

Mr Summerhill, says the impact of a job loss or salary reduction will often be greater on a household than a landlord, who can be expected to have multiple revenue streams.

“We’ve had households who reached out to their lenders and they seem to be very grateful for the fact it’s been a fairly smooth process for the banks to agree these payment delays,” he says.

Haresh Lalwani, managing director at Right Move Mortgage Broker, believes it’s logical for banks to try to provide relief for borrowers at this time and says it is positive for a brand if a lender is proactive.

“People remember which bank supported them during the tough times,"" he says. ""So definitely, it’s a huge plus for them.”

Mr Lalwani benefited himself from a rent relief when his landlord, Sultan bin Ali Al Owais Real Estate. announced a 45-day rent waiver for its tenants at the end of March.

Credit cards

While relief on rents or loans is commonplace, the situation for credit card debt is also more variable, with some banks offering repayment holidays and others not.

Ms Musa says some banks are offering credit card customers the option to postpone their repayments by one month, with deferred interest, while other banks have also reduced their late payment fees on credit cards.

Cardholders may also be able to benefit from 0 per cent interest deals on balance transfers, she says. “Some banks are offering this interest-free deal for up to 12 months, making it a great way for cardholders to repay and settle their outstanding credit card debt faster,"" she adds.

Commercial Bank of Dubai (CBD) is offering a one-month payment holiday for all customers on credit cards and other loans. Customers affected by Covid-19 can also defer their instalments for up to three months.

So far CBD has helped 3,000 customers in the UAE, says Amit Malhotra, general manager, personal banking group. “We are one of the lead banks in the Dubai banks combined relief measures package offer, and we have also undertaken several other initiatives to support our customers during the current coronavirus pandemic,” he says.

Mashreq is also offering a payment holiday of up to three months with no extra fees or charges to “a sizeable number” of the bank’s credit card, home loan and personal loan customers, though current interest rates apply. The banks says it reaching out to these customers directly.

Not all debtors can secure relief from the banks, however. Borrowers who already defaulted on their loans before the crisis are not eligible for financial relief measures such as repayment holidays, despite the financial effects of the crisis worsening their situation, says Ms Musa. Non-residents do not qualify for relief either.

“It is best for such borrowers to approach their bank to see what debt relief options are available to them, and whether the bank can restructure their debts to make repayments more manageable,” she adds.","RAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday.

1,mashreq,27-04-2020,"Contractors are facing delays and additional costs in completing ongoing work and are concerned about their ability to mitigate some of the risks they are facing as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.

Although construction in the UAE has been deemed a vital industry during the lockdown, allowing work on sites to progress, contractors have told The National they are facing additional time and cost pressures.

This is not just an issue confined to the UAE alone. Last week Moody's Investors Service said projects globally ""will face increased operating difficulties during the coronavirus outbreak associated with staff absences, reduced supply of materials and more onerous workplace practices"".

Some project companies and their clients ""are discussing temporary relaxations of parts of the performance regime or payment mechanism, or both"", the ratings agency said.

“We are seeing clients suspend projects – we have had several projects suspended. We have had some clients say, ‘we’re not suspending but we’d be really happy if you guys slowed down’, and we have other clients who are outright telling us, ‘where you were going to bill us $100 this month ... we want you now to make sure you are going to cap this at $50’,” says Bishoy Azmy, chief executive of Dubai-based Al Shafar General Contracting.

However, in terms of making up the additional costs incurred, “neither of us has broached the topic”, Mr Azmy says.

“We’re all recognising that this is quite a global thing. It’s not anybody’s fault. It’s not like the client defaulted, or I defaulted.”

Bishoy Samy Edward, chief executive of Dhabi Contracting, says his company is continuing to work around the clock “with my full force” of about 10,000 workers.

“I’m paying salaries for these people and they need to work so they can get paid – the same for me,” he says.

“I cannot afford putting 2,000 people idle in the camps and pay them nothing. There’s no law saying you can put people in camps and pay them no money. It would be a big problem,” he says.

Contractors have taken precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. Rules have been introduced, such as limiting the number of workers travelling on buses to and from sites. Typically, buses carry about 60 workers but this has been limited to 20.

“Either I make more trips, which will cost me more, or I just get more buses and transfer everyone at the same time. This is what I am doing because I have a huge fleet of buses. However [that] means more fuel [and] more drivers’ salaries,” Mr Edward says.

He has written to clients detailing the extra costs being incurred and requesting their support. He also said social distancing can be impractical on some sites, especially in city centres where footprints are tight and rest areas are small.

The UAE Construction Industry Think Tank, a body co-ordinated by lender Mashreq and industry title MEED, this month called for the introduction of standardised contracts.

A white paper produced by the organisation says contracts are currently written by project owners, meaning the majority of risk in the delivery is borne by the contractor.

The introduction of a standardised construction contract tailored for the UAE could benefit the $710 billion (Dh2.6 trillion) pipeline of projects that are planned or underway by restricting bad behaviour and reducing disputes, the paper states.

“We’re all recognising that this is quite a global thing. It’s not anybody’s fault,"" says Bishoy Azy, chief executive of Al Shafar General Contracting. Jeffrey E Biteng / The National

The additional pressures contractors are facing as a result of Covid-19 has brought this matter to a head, Mashreq Bank’s global head of contracting finance, Mohammad Khader Al Shouli, says.

“I believe there will be a lot of requirements for time extensions, variations and delays without penalties. If that doesn’t really materialise or there is no collaboration on it, I think people will resort to those specific paragraphs in their contracts where force majeure is mentioned,” he says.

Force majeure is a concept in most countries with a civil law code, including the UAE, which will be incorporated in most “construction contracts of any sophistication”, explains Thomas Wilson, a partner at law firm Squire Patton Boggs. In general, it covers an event that “prevents the contractor’s performance of its obligations”.

“Contractual force majeure clauses may cover circumstances such as Covid-19,” says Nesreen Osman, a construction advisory and disputes partner at law firm Pinsent Masons. “Generally, these clauses can excuse a party from its delays but may not allow it to recover additional costs.”

Other contract provisions could help with cost recovery, though, Mr Wilson says.

“In civil law jurisdictions, including the UAE, the law includes provisions for exceptional public circumstances causing performance of a contract not to be impossible but to be extremely burdensome financially. In which case courts or arbitration tribunals can adjust the burdens to the parties to a more reasonable [level]. That’s an interesting provision of the law that will be used when the dust settles, but it is not going to be applicable in all respects and it is not a panacea,” he said.

“Generally, these clauses can excuse a party from its delays but may not allow it to recover additional costs.” Nesreen Osman, partner, Pinsent Masons

One measure that should be avoided, according to Mr Al Shouli, is the withdrawal of performance bonds, which are sums contractors have to provide at the outset of a contract that typically serve as open-ended guarantees.

“Those instruments need to be now tackled with caution and with care,” he says. “Today, you cannot use them to pressure a contractor or to agree to certain changes or discounts that you used to do in the past because it puts so much pressure on the system, and on the contractor. I believe that a lot of contractors will not be able to survive [withdrawal of bonds].”

The heads of three major Abu Dhabi government branches - the Department of Economic Development, the Department of Municipalities and Transport and the Department for Culture and Tourism – held meetings with business owners and investors in a number of industries to discuss the impact of Covid-19, including the contracting sector. They heard concerns from contractors about the importance of keeping funding flowing to projects and calls for regulatory consistency, the departments said in a statement on Sunday.

""The challenges faced by the contracting sector and their companies in these circumstances makes us more adamant to increase our cooperation and efforts with all strategic partners concerned to reach immediate and more effective solutions and presenting proposals for quick and more impactful measures that revitalise the sector in the short term, while contributing to enhancing investor confidence in the national economy in the long run,” said the Department of Economic Development's chairman, Mohammed Al Shorafa.

Mashreq's Mr Al Shouli says the lender is continuing to extend support to contractors in terms of financing projects that face cashflow disruption and pointed out that in some instances – especially for many government-related projects – payments are being accelerated.

“We used to get within 60 days of certification, now we are getting within 20 days of certification.""

However, he says non-essential spend – for acquisitions, or anything not related to projects – is being discouraged.

One of the most pressing issues for contractors currently is repatriating workers whose contracts have ended, given that some countries have temporarily closed borders even for returning nationals, and flights are unavailable.

“Now, a lot of our workforce aren’t even able to go home,” ASGC's Mr Azmy said. “If that’s for two weeks, maybe we can shift them to other sites that are working. If it’s a month maybe we can shift them a little and pay them some of their paid leave. But if it’s three months, obviously we’re not going to be able to take that huge cost ourselves and we’re going to be looking for help either from clients or government. We don’t really know.”","Contractors are facing delays and additional costs in completing ongoing work and are concerned about their ability to mitigate some of the risks they are facing as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.

2,mashreq,20-04-2020,"During the Covid-19 crisis in the UAE, certain needs such as buying groceries and medicine are considered essential.

But what about sending money home? With its majority expatriate population, the UAE is one of the highest outward remittance countries in the world. Many migrant workers have families in their home countries who depend on them for financial support.

Exchange houses and banks are still allowed to open, but some are closed or only operating reduced hours. Money transfer companies in the Emirates have seen a sharp rise in the use of digital channels as residents are told to stay home to prevent the spread of the virus. Yet, that is not an option for the “unbanked”, who don’t have a bank account, credit card or debit card.

As well as the restrictions, convenience, cost and speed are other factors to consider. Here we guide you through the options to remit money from the UAE, as the worldwide coronavirus outbreak and precautionary measures continue.

The UAE is one of the largest outbound remittance countries in the world with the vast majority of personal remittances sent through exchange houses. Victor Besa / The National

Exchange houses are considered a support service

The vast majority of personal remittances are sent through exchange houses. Of the Dh165.2 billion sent from the Emirates last year, Dh131.2bn was remitted through exchange houses and Dh34bn through banks, according to the Central Bank’s 2019 annual report.

The Covid-19 crisis has changed the world as we know it, with more than 2.4 million confirmed cases across the globe and over 165,000 deaths as of Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Most countries around the world, including the UAE, continue to enforce physical distancing and movement restrictions, including business closures, travel bans and stay-home directives.

In Dubai, residents can apply for a movement permit every three days to buy essentials or an emergency, and every five days for ATM cash withdrawal. A DXB move permit call centre representative (800-737648) said applicants should choose “emergency” if they need to send money home and explain the reason under the description.

Rashed Al Ansari, chief executive of Al Ansari Exchange, says exchange houses have been designated by the Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management as a “support service” because “we play an instrumental role in paying wages to a large segment of the workforce here in the UAE through the Wage Protection System (WPS) and also provide remittance services for them”.

The mandatory Wage Protection System, developed by the central bank, requires every private sector employer to choose a registered agent, such as banks, exchange houses and financial institutions, to record wage payments, ensuring they are paid on time at the agreed rate.

Some exchange houses are closed, while others operate shorter hours

Shopping malls and non-essential businesses have closed in the Emirates, following government directives. At first, it was understood that mall branches of banks and exchange houses would be included in the closures. However, Osama Al Rahma, chief executive of Al Fardan Exchange, says the decision depends on a mall's management, business flow and specific government restrictions.

In Abu Dhabi, for example, Al Fardan branches in Al Wahda Mall and Marina Mall have closed, Mr Al Rahma says, while other locations are shut due to the nationwide disinfection drive, such as the Gold Souk branch in Dubai.

Osama Al Rahma, chief executive of Al Fardan Exchange and FERG Vice Chairman, says most exchange house branches remain open. Leslie Pableo / The National

Al Ansari, which has more than 190 branches across the UAE, has only closed a few branches. These include Dubai Outlet Mall, Dubai Mall and Dragon Mart as well as Souq Murshid and Naif in Deira. In Abu Dhabi, Marina Mall and Yas Mall branches are closed, while in Sharjah, Sahara Centre is closed.

Orient Exchange has closed a handful of locations out of its 25 branches in the UAE, says its chief executive Rajiv Raipancholia.

Banks have closed a higher proportion of branches, as most transactions can be carried out online or through ATMs. Emirates NBD, for example, is only operating 17 “strategically located branches nationwide with limited services” from April 11, according to its website. First Abu Dhabi Bank, meanwhile, has temporarily closed 50 of its branches and kept 25 open.

In Dubai, exchange houses are only allowed to operate between the hours of 8am and 2pm. In the rest of the UAE, they are allowed to operate for longer. It is advisable to call ahead to check the latest updates, as the situation is fluid.

Banks also have reduced branch timings, most choosing to operate from 8am or 9am until 12pm or 1pm.

There are plenty of online alternatives

In recent years, exchange houses and banks have ramped up their digital offerings amid rising competition to make transfers more convenient, cheaper and faster. This helps those who do not want to leave the house during Covid-19 to make transfers.

Last week, global low-cost digital money transfer service TransferWise started operating in the UAE, six months after receiving its licence from Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The platform lets users send money online at the mid-market exchange rate – the midpoint between demand and supply for a currency – and charges an upfront, transparent fee.

TransferWise says a quarter of its transactions globally are completed in less than 20 seconds. The service has the added benefit that it is fully online without the need to verify identity in person.

Banks also offer customers digital transfer options, such as Mashreq Bank’s Quick Remit and Emirates NBD’s DirectRemit.

Last month, FAB partnered with MasterCard to offer the payit mobile wallet, which delivers instant remittances to select bank accounts and wallets internationally. There are no fees, while exchange rates are “well benchmarked to the market”, a FAB spokesperson said.

“Bringing this technology to the market as early as possible is crucial now more than ever,” said Hana Al Rostamani, group head of personal banking at FAB.

ToTok, an instant messaging app used by more than 20 million people worldwide, launched ToTok Pay for android smartphone owners in the UAE on March 23, with users able to send money to friends and family through ToTok chat.

ToTok co-founder Giacomo Ziani hopes the company's contactless and cashless payment method will ""play a small part in helping protect public health"" in the UAE at this time.

Western Union, which rolled out its digital money transfer services in the UAE last year, allows customers to make online transfers using debit, credit and pre-paid cards, as well as bank accounts, in its global network of 100 countries.

Many exchange houses say their money transfer apps have seen a huge sharp rise in demand amid the outbreak. Lulu Money is clocking over 5,000 downloads daily with overall transactions rising 35 per cent relative to January. The company has also handled 6,000 chats per week, a spike of 450 per cent from its earlier average of 5,000 per month.

“The adoption rate to digital has accelerated in recent weeks, as people slowly realise the medium’s inherent advantages,” says Adeeb Ahamed, managing director of Lulu International Exchange. “We have noticed customers switch over to our secure mobile app, Lulu Money, at an exponential rate.”

While 90 per cent of Lulu Money's transactions are processed in under 15 seconds, the rest take less than a minute, he says. However, the app can only be used by existing customers who have completed the KYC (Know Your Customer) process in physical branches. New customers must visit branches to verify their identity.

Rashed Al Ansari, chief executive of Al Ansari Exchange, says the money transfer operator's digital app has seen a transaction increase of more than 40 per cent in March. Photo courtesy Al Ansari

Al Ansari recorded over 110,000 online transactions in March, an increase of more than 40 per cent. However, transactions made through the mobile app only represent 7 per cent of Al Ansari’s total remittances.

“Despite the surge in mobile app remittance, a large segment of the population still prefers visiting brick-and-mortar branches,” says Mr Al Ansari.

Again, new customers have to initially visit the branch to verify their identity and, more importantly, digital options are not available to the “unbanked” population.

Mr Al Ansari says the exchange house is in the final stages of developing a feature in its mobile app that enables customers to remit money from their WPS card directly without visiting a branch and without the need for a “full-fledged bank account”.

FinTech start-ups, such as Now Money, Rise and Denarii Cash, offer low-cost options to those who don't have a bank account or access to other money transfer methods.

Comparing the cost will become key

Several variables affect the cost of money transfers, such as the method used, destination and amount to be remitted.

“It’s also important for customers to recognise that although the headline exchange rate can seem attractive, when fees are added the overall cost can increase significantly and this should be taken into consideration when comparing costs,” says Graham Flannery, chief executive of Wall Street Exchange.

The World Bank publishes cost comparisons on its website, covering 12 corridors from the UAE, including top receivers India, Pakistan and the Philippines. It also includes the speed of the transfer, which can vary from less than a minute to a couple of days.

With the coronavirus crisis, people have become more savvy when it comes to exploring their options.

“Before Covid-19 and after Covid-19, I think we will find a major change in consumer behaviours,” says Mr Al Rahma, who is also vice chairman of the Foreign Exchange and Remittance Group (FERG), representing more than 70 exchange houses in the UAE. “People used to be hesitant to use apps … this will totally change the mindset.”","Here we guide you through the options to remit money from the UAE, as the worldwide coronavirus outbreak and precautionary measures continue.

3,mashreq,16-04-2020,"Mashreq Bank, the Dubai lender controlled by the Al Ghurair family, reported a 28 per cent drop in its first-quarter net profit, as global interest rates declined and economic activity remained subdued amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Net profit for the three months ending March 31 declined to Dh450 million, the lender said in a statement to the Dubai Financial Market, where its shares trade. Revenue slid 3 per cent year-on-year to Dh1.52 billion and impairment allowances rose 56.5 per cent to Dh409m.

“These are difficult times for the whole world and despite a tough operating environment, Mashreq continued its positive growth trajectory in the first quarter of 2020,” Ahmed Abdelaal, group chief executive of Mashreq Bank, said.

“We achieved a respectable ... net profit for the first quarter of 2020 despite strong headwinds like steep decline in interest rates and [the] impact of the Covid-19 crisis.""

The lender's revenue also remained stable with loans and advances growing by almost 3 per cent during the reporting period, Mr Abdelaal noted.

Investment income more than doubled to Dh127m. Net interest income and income from Islamic financing, however, slid 16.5 per cent to Dh782m, Mashreq said.

Lenders across the globe are at risk of a decline in profitability as loan growth slows and interest rates plunge amid the coronavirus pandemic. The global economy could experience the worst recession this year since the 1930s great depression. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday projected a 3 per cent contraction in 2020 and said the outlook for the world economy is worse than the 2008 global economic crisis.

The UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, was the first in the Middle East and North Africa to roll out Dh282bn in fiscal and monetary support, providing zero interest funding to banks to boost lending growth in the country. The government, in addition, has also implemented a variety of other initiatives that range from discounted utility bills to waivers of fees to buttress the economy.

Mashreq on Thursday said its assets grew 2 per cent to Dh162.6bn, while loans and advances rose 2.8 per cent from the end of last year to reach Dh78.3bn. Customer deposits, however, fell 2.7 per cent to Dh88.5bn during the period.

“Given the unprecedented situation we are facing now, we invoked several management actions during the quarter, aimed at ensuring the safety and security of all our stakeholders as well as supporting their financial well-being,” said Mr Abdelaal.

Mashreq is among UAE banks that have rolled out a comprehensive package to reduce financial distress of their clientele. Banking benefits packages extend relief to businesses and individuals, particularly in stressed sectors, through reduced costs and fees, loan deferrals, reduced interest rates and processing fees.

Earlier this month, the UAE Central Bank urged lenders to support the private sector and individual borrowers to cushion the impact of Covid-19 and disbursed Dh10bn worth of zero interest loans to banks from the Targeted Economic Support Scheme launched in March.","Mashreq Bank, the Dubai lender controlled by the Al Ghurair family, reported a 28 per cent drop in its first-quarter net profit, as global interest rates declined and economic activity remained subdued amid the coronavirus pandemic.

4,mashreq,12-04-2020,"Banks in the UAE do not need more stimulus from the central bank to deal with the coronavirus impact, although the government has many tools at its disposal to support the economy if needed.

“The good news is [that] today we do not need more ... what we have [right now] is good,” Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, chairman of the UAE Banks Federation, said. “If things improve, we will return this money and if things deteriorate and the world goes into [a] 10 per cent [economic] shrinkage, there will be a different decision at that time.”

The Central Bank of the UAE on March 14 rolled out a Dh100 billion ($27bn) stimulus to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus on the country’s economy. The package was boosted to Dh256bn on April 5 when the banking regulator halved banks' capital buffer requirements to 7 per cent. The central bank also extended the duration of the Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess) for affected retail and corporate customers, allowing banks and finance companies to defer the principal amount of loans and interest until the end of this year.

The aggregate value of all capital and liquidity measures now include Dh50bn in capital buffer relief, Dh50bn in zero-cost funding support, Dh95bn in liquidity buffer relief and a Dh61bn reduction in cash reserve requirements. On the fiscal side, the UAE government has also launched several initiatives worth Dh26bn to reduce the cost of living and support smaller businesses.

Of the Dh256bn central bank initiative, Dh205bn is liquidity made available to the banks for lending, Mr Al Ghurair, who is also chairman of Dubai’s Mashreq bank, said. The remainder is a relief package for individual borrowers and companies in sectors affected by the coronavirus.

“The relief [package] is supposed to be used exclusively for commercial companies and individuals and not to be used to fund GREs [government-related entities] or government institutions,” he noted.

Total lending in the UAE currently stands at about Dh1.6 trillion, out of which Dh1tn is loaned to individuals and commercial entities. The Dh205bn in available liquidity is enough for the banks to maintain their average annual loan growth over the last five years for the next four, he added.

Government and central banks around the world have rolled out monetary and fiscal initiatives to soften the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on businesses. The virus has infected more than 1.7 million people globally and killed close to 110,000, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the outbreak. More than 409,000 people have recovered from the disease.

Rate cuts, dedicated liquidity lines, wage protection schemes, loan guarantees and direct aid to households are among the measures that have already been implemented in a number of countries.

“Today we have enough liquidity to look after our requirements and to support our economy to ensure it comes out of this challenge,” Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, chairman of the UAE Banks Federation, said

The UAE, Mr Al Ghurair said, has several such tools to support the economy. Lowering tariffs and fees, an SME loan guarantee programme, employee salary guarantees or even the federal government buying back government loans are some of the options.

“Today we have enough liquidity to look after our [lending] requirements and to support our economy to ensure it comes out of this challenge,” he noted.

On the debt crisis facing the embattled UAE healthcare firm NMC Health, Mr Al Ghurair said the decision to put the company under administration is a protective move. It ensures that “there’s no playing around with whatever money is there” and also to protect the records.

A UK court placed Abu Dhabi-based NMC Health into administration last week on the request Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, its biggest lender, which has an exposure of $981 million (Dh3.6bn) to the healthcare company. The size of its lending increases to $1.16bn when factoring in Finablr, another company owned by NMC Health's founder BR Shetty, which is not in administration. Overall, UAE banks have a combined exposure of at least Dh8bn to NMC Health.

It is in interest of banks to keep NMC business going “as long as possible” to recover their money, he added.

“If you present their balance sheet today, people will still lend them. Banks do not plan for fraud … this is a world-class fraud,” Mr Al Ghurair said. “I think the management and the board members [of NMC] should be held accountable.”","“The good news is [that] today we do not need more ... what we have [right now] is good,” Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, chairman of the UAE Banks Federation, said.
Of the Dh256bn central bank initiative, Dh205bn is liquidity made available to the banks for lending, Mr Al Ghurair, who is also chairman of Dubai’s Mashreq bank, said.
Government and central banks around the world have rolled out monetary and fiscal initiatives to soften the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on businesses.

5,mashreq,06-04-2020,"Publicly listed companies were asked by UAE market regulators to outline their exposure to NMC Health – the country’s biggest healthcare operator which looks set to be placed into administration at a UK High Court hearing today.

Given the ties between the company, which was founded by BR Shetty in 1975, and Finablr – in which Mr Shetty retains a majority stake – companies were also asked to declare any exposure to that group, and to its largest local entity, UAE Exchange.

Banks have the greatest exposure, having extended loans and invested in sukuk worth more than Dh10 billion. Banks from other Gulf states have also begun reporting their exposure.

But insurers and other companies have also declared investments and other relationships, including money that is owed to NMC Health.

6,mashreq,05-04-2020,"The UAE’s publicly-listed companies began reporting their exposure to NMC Health, the embattled healthcare operator, which is at risk of being placed into administration.

As of Sunday, banks in the UAE had declared a combined exposure of about Dh8.04 billion ($2.16bn) in the form of loans to the group and its subsidiaries.

Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, the company’s biggest individual lender, is owed $981 million, it said in a statement to the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange last week. ADCB on Saturday said it has approached the UK's High Court to place NMC Health into administration “to protecting its interest and assuring the long-term sustainability of the company”.

Dubai Islamic Bank, the largest Sharia-compliant lender in the UAE, said it is owed $425m. It also said Noor Bank, which it acquired in January, has a loan exposure of $116m.

“The bank has been monitoring recent developments at the [NMC] group. In conjunction with other substantial creditors, the bank is now in discussions with the group and its advisers to ascertain the group’s financial position and identify potential measures to address the group’s governance and financial issues,” DIB said in a statement to the Dubai Financial Market, where its shares trade.

The lender said it is “taking appropriate actions to protect its interests and fully appreciates the vital role that the group’s healthcare services play in our local communities, particularly at this time”.

Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank reported loan exposure of $291.4m to the healthcare company, and said it had a $31m investment in a sukuk issued by the company. Reem Investments also declared a $1m investment in NMC Health's sukuk.

Dubai's largest lender, Emirates NBD, reported Dh747.34m, including Dh676.46m to Emirates Islamic Bank. Khaleeji Commercial Bank said it is owed $30m by the healthcare firm.

Ajman Bank declared an exposure of Dh151.9m to NMC, while United Arab Bank reported total exposure of Dh135.3m. The National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah, RAKBank, said it is owed Dh100.2m, Sharjah Islamic Bank is owed Dh29.6m and Mashreq Bank said it is owed Dh502,598 from subsidiary New Medical Centre Training.

An equities fund controlled by the bank, Makaseb Arab Tigers Fund, also holds 25,000 shares in the company.

Al Salam Bank revealed a transaction where it had offloaded some shares, but it retains a direct stake of about 4.9 per cent in NMC and an indirect stake of just below 3 per cent.

Aramex, the largest courier company in the Middle East, said it is owed about Dh335,000 by NMC and UAE Exchange, which was also founded by NMC’s founder, B R Shetty, and is owned by Finablr, a listed London entity in which Mr Shetty retains a majority stake.

Regulators asked listed firms to declare their exposure to NMC Health, UAE Exchange (whose operations are being overseen by the Central Bank of the UAE) and Finablr.

ADCB said it is owed a further $182m by Finablr Group and its subsidiaries, including UAE Exchange.

Commercial Bank International declared Dh425.6m to NMC Health, Finablr and UAE Exchange, but it did not break down how much it was owed by each company.

National Bank of Fujairah put its total exposure to the three entities at Dh289.1m, with the bulk of this (Dh276.2m) owed by Finablr group and its subsidiaries.

Umm Al Qaiwain-based bank NBQ said it is owed Dh50m by UAE Exchange

NMC Health’s new chairman Faisal Belhoul has requested lenders enter into a standstill agreement on the company’s debt, and said placing the company in administration ""would cause instability to the operating businesses of the NMC Group, creating additional pressure on the group’s liquidity and reducing value for all creditors”.

""This would be damaging not only to the interests of creditors but, in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, would potentially put lives at risk,” said Mr Belhoul, whose private equity company Ithmar Capital acquired a 9 per cent stake in the business in late March.

He also pledged the company would be more transparent and put stronger governance structures in place.

ADCB, however, said it is seeking the appointment of administrators to “safeguard the future of NMC Health and its subsidiaries”, arguing that its requests for greater transparency to date had been ignored by the company.

It served notice of its intention to apply to the High Court to place the company into administration on Friday, saying the joint administrators appointed would launch a “full, transparent and independent investigation” into the company’s affairs.

NMC Health is understood to have exposure to more than 80 local, regional and international financial institutions, according to the filings of ADCB and DIB.

The company was forced to make a series of damaging disclosures in the last few months after a report by activist investor Muddy Waters in December, which alleged it had inflated cash balances, overpaid for its assets and understated its debt.

Last month, it said its debt stood at $6.6bn (Dh24.24bn), substantially higher than the $2.1bn declared in its last filed accounts. A review committee also discovered evidence of “suspected fraudulent behaviour”.

Two joint chairmen, including the company’s founder, an executive vice-chairman, a chief executive, a chief financial officer and a member of its treasury team have all resigned from the business.

7,mashreq,31-03-2020,"The banking and finance industry is vital to the financial health of the country and its main trade body is working “hand in hand” with the central bank to ensure continuity of operations, the chairman of the UAE Banks Federation said.

“As a critical industry, the banking sector has an especially unique responsibility to safeguard society and the economic environment,” Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, who is also the chairman of Dubai-based Mashreq bank, said following the first virtual meeting of the UBF board.

“This will continue to be our utmost priority, and we will do whatever it takes to fullfil our mandate to support banks and [the] local community as we navigate through this uncertainty together.”

The meeting also discussed initiatives that UBF, a body representing 53 lenders in the country, will roll out this year. These measures are aimed at increasing innovation in the banking industry, enhancing Emiratisation and supporting the country's real estate sector, a significant contributor to national economic activity.

Support for the real estate sector and development of the mortgage market in the UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, were among the priorities laid out by the Central Bank of the UAE in its Dh100 billion economic stimulus package announced earlier this month.

The regulator's Targeted Economic Support includes Dh50bn from central bank funds through collateralised loans at zero cost to all banks operating in the UAE and Dh50bn of funds freed from banks’ capital buffers. The package also includes measures that will help facilitate access to finance for small and medium-sized firms and reduce fees that will help soften the impact of Covid-19 on the country’s economy.

The package will “give a significant boost to the UAE banking sector and have [a] far-reaching impact on various sectors that underpin the economy”, Mr Al Ghurair said in a March 15 statement. “The UAE banking sector has sufficient liquidity and is adequately capitalised and we are well-positioned to weather challenges that lie ahead.”

Dubai banks – including Emirates NBD, Mashreq, Commercial Bank of Dubai, Dubai Islamic Bank and Emirates Islamic – have already released a package of financial initiatives for their clientele, which includes fee waivers and loan instalment holidays. Abu Dhabi lenders, including First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, have also offered similar relief to their customers in a bid to help ease financial strains.

“It is important that we [do] not lose sight of our vision during these difficult times, and continue to promote growth and transformation across the industry for the benefit of the wider country,” Mr Al Ghurair said.

“Whether it is tackling the ever-changing challenges in the market, or fostering policies and frameworks to drive innovation, we are continuously working towards a sustainable and diversified economy to secure a better future for the entire nation.”","The banking and finance industry is vital to the financial health of the country and its main trade body is working “hand in hand” with the central bank to ensure continuity of operations, the chairman of the UAE Banks Federation said.

8,mashreq,30-03-2020,"As the coronavirus outbreak continues to ravage economies across the globe, major banks in the UAE have rolled out measures to provide financial relief to customers.

The measures – which include payment holidays for between one to three months, reductions in cash advance charges and a lower down payment for first-time home buyers – are in line with the UAE Central Bank’s Dh100 billion economic stimulus package unveiled on March 14.

But what about foreign banks in the UAE, including Citi, HSBC and Standard Chartered? They too have taken action to help customers cope with the financial fallout from the efforts to contain Covid-19.

While Dubai banks – including Emirates NBD, Mashreq, Commercial Bank of Dubai, Dubai Islamic Bank and Emirates Islamic – and Abu Dhabi banks – including First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank – have co-ordinated and released common financial initiatives in each emirate, foreign banks have released initiatives individually. The measures, as well as the criteria for customers to qualify, vary.

Worldwide, there are over 723,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with more than 34,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins as of Monday. More than 152,000 have recovered. In the UAE, there are 570 cases with three deaths and 58 recoveries.

Containment measures in the UAE, such as stay-at-home directives and business closures, could cause a decline in revenue for companies, and a cut in income or job losses for individuals.

Here we break down what Citi, HSBC and Standard Chartered are doing to help those affected by Covid-19 in the Emirates, either directly or indirectly.

Citi Group, which has its headquarters in New York, had total assets of around $1.9tn last year. Joseph J Capellan / The National

Citi

Earlier this month, Citi made fund transfers free through the mobile app until April 30. It also said it would donate 0.5 per cent of all debit card spends in the month of March to help with the efforts to combat Covid-19.

The bank introduced additional measures last week and is in the process of rolling out others, Dinesh Sharma, head of Citi's Middle East consumer bank division, told The National. Citi has around 300,000 customers in the UAE.

If customers with existing loans are facing reduced cash flow, a temporary loss of payment or redundancy, they can apply for a 75 per cent reduction in their monthly instalments with significantly lower interest. “If a customer was paying Dh1,000 a month, that can go down to Dh250,” Mr Sharma says. Previously, the rewrite programme allowed customers to apply for a reduction of up to 50 per cent.

Customers facing difficulties for a short period of time have the option to request a payment holiday through the bank’s “skip a payment” programme, Mr Sharma says. Previously clients could apply for a payment holiday of up to two months. Now, they can defer the principle payments for three months and then ask to extend it by another three months.

“In total, a customer can get a temporary relief of six months or he/she can get permanent relief on a restructure in case the difficult situation is permanent,” Mr Sharma says. “Close to 200 customers have already approached us,” he added.

Citi is looking into reducing credit card cash advance charges by 50 per cent, as local banks have done. However, Mr Sharma says this feature is used by less than 10 per cent of its customers in the UAE market.

“Our main focus is to make sure the features we’re providing are making a real difference to customers, so we also look at the usage rates,” he said.

Similar to local banks, Citi has removed the Dh2 fee to use other banks' ATMS for three months from April 1 until June 30.

The bank has approved waiving the fee on its “Citi PayAll” programme, which allows customers to pay for rent, property maintenance, education, travel plans and special events in monthly instalments using their credit card. The fee, as per the December 2019 schedule of fees and charges, is up to 4 per cent of the transaction amount plus VAT.

The rewrite and payment holiday programmes are applied on a case-by-case basis, while the free transfers, temporary waiver of ATM charges and removal of Citi PayAll fee are for all customers.

When asked what constitutes being “affected” by Covid-19, Mr Sharma said: “It could be anything. It could be that somebody in the family has contracted the virus or is in quarantine. It could be customers who have been asked to go on leave without payment … No one is excluded.”

On a global level, the Citi Foundation said on March 19 it will provide $15 million (Dh55m) to support relief activities related to Covid-19.

HSBC

HSBC has released “Covid-19 guidance and FAQs” on its UAE website. It outlines a package of measures, effective immediately, to help its customers and “contribute to the initiatives announced by the Central Bank of the UAE to support the country’s economy”.

“We are staying very close to all of our customers – our priority is to work with them and help them navigate any challenges they currently face,” Daniel Robinson, head of retail banking and wealth management at HSBC UAE, told The National. The bank's relief measures include:

• Customers who have been placed on unpaid leave by their employers can apply for a one-month repayment holiday without interest and fees for their personal loans, mortgages and car loans.

• Charges will be refunded on cash withdrawals and balance enquiries made at all non-HSBC ATMs across the UAE and GCC (in place since March 15).

• School fees paid by credit card qualify for an instalment plan of up to six months starting from 0 per cent interest with processing fees waived.

• All first-time home buyers can benefit from a 5 per cent increase in the loan-to-value ratio for mortgages.

These are similar to measures introduced by Dubai and Abu Dhabi banks. However, local lenders are offering a repayment holiday of up to three months for those placed on unpaid leave and all customers are eligible for one-month payment holidays.

HSBC customers can also apply for temporary increases in credit card limits, subject to eligibility. The bank has increased daily ATM cash withdrawal and purchase limits since March 19.

The bank is encouraging clients to contact their relationship manager for help and make use of the automated phone banking service, rather than visiting a branch.

HSBC said last week it is providing $25m in charitable donations to support the international medical response, protect vulnerable people and ensure food security around the world.

Standard Chartered

Standard Chartered in the UAE has launched a series of measures “to help ease the financial burden"" on their clients, effective from April 1 to June 30, according to a post on its website.

These include:

• All clients affected by Covid-19 can ask the bank for a three-month repayment holiday on their existing personal loans, car loans and mortgages with zero interest and fees.

• All clients can choose to pay only the interest component of their existing loan for a period of three months.

• For credit card transactions over Dh1,000 on hospital fees, school fees, utility bills and grocery payments, purchases can be converted into equal monthly instalments at 0 per cent interest and no processing fees.

• The foreign currency transaction fees on cancelled travel bookings will be refunded.

• Cash advance fees on credit cards will be cut in half.

Only UAE residents are eligible for the relief measures and it is limited to clients who are “up-to-date with their payment obligations”.

Those who are financially affected by Covid-19 can avail the measures by sending an email to covid.19relief@sc.com. They must provide certain documents to claim temporary relief from payments, such as: a letter from the employer stating the impact of Covid-19 as the reason for unpaid leave or termination; a note from the Ministry of Health confirming you were infected by Covid-19; evidence that Covid-19 has directly or indirectly affected the ability to pay due to travel restrictions or quarantine; or bank statements reflecting the revenue loss of more than 20 per cent, month on month, if self-employed.

On Monday, Standard Chartered said it would commit $1bn of financing for companies worldwide that provide goods and services to help the fight against Covid-19, or those who plan to switch into making products that are in high demand to address the crisis. The bank will provide, at preferential rates, the money in the form of loans, import/export finance or the working capital facilities companies use for day-to-day business operations.","As the coronavirus outbreak continues to ravage economies across the globe, major banks in the UAE have rolled out measures to provide financial relief to customers.

We recognise the need to protect those most vulnerable and are committed to lending a helping hand during this uncertain time. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, Emirates NBD

Under a Dh100 billion economic stimulus package unveiled by the UAE Central Bank on March 14, lenders in the Emirates were ordered to “treat all their customers fairly” and grant “temporary relief"" on retail clients’ loan payments for up to six months from March 15.

The Targeted Economic Support Scheme includes Dh50bn from central bank funds through collateralised loans at zero cost to all banks operating in the UAE and Dh50bn of funds freed from banks’ capital buffers.

Emirates NBD, the biggest bank by assets in Dubai, along with the UAE’s largest Sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates Islamic, Mashreq and Commercial Bank of Dubai announced a series of support measures that will remain in effect for three months starting April 1, the Dubai government media office said on March 21.

In Abu Dhabi, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank are offering support measures for customers. The three banks have introduced 17 initiatives to support individuals and businesses, the Abu Dhabi media office said in a tweet on Wednesday.

Elsewhere in the UAE, Ras al Khaimah's RAKBank, Sharjah Islamic Bank and Commercial Bank International – which is based in Dubai and listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange – have also pledged to help customers.

Worldwide, there are over 425,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with more than 18,900 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins as of Wednesday. More than 109,000 have recovered. In the UAE, there are more than 240 cases with two deaths and 45 recoveries.

Containment measures in the UAE, such as stay-at-home directives and cancelled flights, could cause a decline in revenue for businesses, and a cut in income or job losses for individuals.

“At a time like this, ensuring the UAE's banking system's stability is of utmost importance,” said Ambareen Musa, chief executive of souqalmal.com. “It's great to see banks step up and support the government and the central bank’s economic relief efforts.”

Some banks have even set up dedicated phone lines and email accounts to offer support to retail and business customers who have been financially affected by the Covid-19 crisis, Ms Musa said.

Even when there aren’t specific clauses that address your individual situation, banks are offering refinancing, repayment deferrals or lower repayments where required.

“We recognise the need to protect those most vulnerable and are committed to lending a helping hand during this uncertain time,” said Emirates NBD chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed.

Bank branches outside shopping malls will remain open for now and ATM services are operational, but the central bank has urged customers to use digital and online channels as much as possible.

A series of monetary and fiscal measures by the central bank and government provide support for people and businesses, while local lenders have also stepped up with payment holidays that should create a buffer in the coming three months.

Individual emirates in the UAE are extending special support packages to help smaller businesses and some of the more vulnerable sectors of the economy to brave the unprecedented crisis that has wreaked havoc on the global economy and put millions of jobs at stake as travel and tourism come to a grinding halt.

The National lists what state measures have been taken to support the people and economy of the UAE :

Central Bank of UAE

On March 14, the regulator introduced a Dh100 billion ($27bn) comprehensive economic monetary package – the Targeted Economic Support Scheme – which provides funding to banks and allows them to delay principal and interest payments for up to six months on loans to all private sector and retail borrowers affected by the pandemic.

The package includes Dh50bn from the Central Bank funds through collateralised loans at zero interest rate to all UAE lenders . The regulator has allowed reduction in capital buffers, which will free up Dh50bn of banks’ lending capacity. The overall package equates to 6.4 per cent of UAE lenders' domestic credit as of January.

The regulator ordered banks to use the funding “to grant temporary relief” to private sector corporate customers and retail clients for up to six months. The Central Bank has also reduced the amount of capital banks have to hold for their loans to SMEs by 15 to 25 per cent. This will increase available financing to small companies. It also raised the loan-to-value ratios applicable to mortgage loans for first-time homebuyers by 5 percentage points.

Abu Dhabi stimulus initiative

On March 16, Abu Dhabi detailed a plan to stimulate economic growth and support the private sector in the emirate.

The 16-point agenda unveiled by Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, includes allocation of Dh5bn to subsidise water and electricity for citizens and commercial and industrial activities; reduces electricity connection fees for start-ups until the end of this year; and exempts all commercial and industrial activities from Tawtheeq fees in 2020.

The government has also allocated Dh3bn for the SME credit guarantee scheme, dedicated Dh1bn to establish a market maker fund to stabilise stock markets and issued directives to settle all approved government payables and invoices within 15 working days.

The state has exempted start-ups from performance guarantees for projects up to Dh50 million, reduced industrial land leasing fees by 25 per cent on new contracts, suspended real estate registration fees for the remainder of this year and waived current commercial and industrial penalties.

Waiving annual registration fees for commercial vehicles , exempting all vehicles from traffic tariffs and road tolls this year and suspending tourism and municipality fees in 2020, are among the other reprieves .

Dubai stimulus package

On March 13, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, Crown Prince of Dubai, unveiled an economic support package worth Dh1.5bn, which includes measures to protect businesses, especially in tourism, retail, external trade and logistics services.

The government has introduced nine initiatives over the next three months, including a freeze on the 2.5 per cent market fees for all facilities operating in Dubai, refund of 20 per cent on the customs fees imposed on imported products sold locally and a 10 per cent cut to water and electricity bills for three months.

Total government support package

The UAE government increased its stimulus to Dh126bn on March 22, when Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President and Ruler of Dubai, announced an additional support package of Dh16bn. “We approved new measures to cut the cost of doing business, support small businesses and accelerate major infrastructure projects,” he wrote on Twitter .

Measures by UAE banks

Banks in Dubai are offering clients loan repayment holidays and reduced fees and charges to help ease financial distress. Emirates NBD, Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates Islamic, Mashreq, and Commercial Bank of Dubai on Saturday announced a series of support measures that will remain in effect for three months starting April 1. The steps include repayment holiday of up to three months with zero interest and fees for retail loan customers, placed on unpaid leave by their employers.

Those who took out personal and car loans, or mortgages can apply for a one-month repayment holiday with no fees.

A 5 per cent increase in the loan-to-value ratio and full waiver of processing fees can be availed by first-time homebuyers.

Credit card customers will be allowed interest-free insta lment plans for all school fee payments as well as grocery purchases with no processing fees for up to six months.

SME clients can avail a repayment holiday of three months with zero interest and fees. For wholesale banking, lenders are prioritising relief measures for key industry sectors including health care, aviation, hospitality, retail, event management, consumer goods and education, by offering refinancing, repayment deferrals or lower repayments where required.

Apart from the facilities offered by their conventional peers, Dubai Islamic Bank and Emirates Islamic are offering option to apply for debt consolidation solutions where appropriate. The lenders will also work with the customers facing margin calls on their shares portfolio.

""All differences are dwarfed in front of this new challenge and the world can overcome it faster if the strong stand with the weak and the rich with the poor.""

The increase in stimulus follows a slew of other initiatives and and aid rolled out by the government and private sector this month.

On Saturday, banks in Dubai said they will offer their customers and clients loan repayment holidays and reduced charges to help soften the impact of Covid-19 on their finances and relieve economic pressure.

The pandemic is the greatest challenge to the global economy since the 2008 financial crisis and has wiped at least $17 trillion (Dh62.44tn) from stock markets worldwide. It has disrupted global supply chains, brought the travel and tourism sector almost to a grinding halt.

Emirates NBD, the biggest bank by assets in Dubai along with UAE’s largest Sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates Islamic, Mashreq and Commercial Bank of Dubai have announced a series of support measures that will remain in effect for three months starting April 1, the Dubai government media office said on Saturday.

The measures follow the Central Bank of the UAE's Dh100bn stimulus unveiled earlier this month, and separate packages from the Abu Dhabi and Dubai government that entail reduced or exempted fees for a range of services.

The measures follow the Central Bank of the UAE's Dh100 billion stimulus unveiled earlier this month, and separate packages from the Abu Dhabi and Dubai government that entail reduced or exempted fees for a range of services. The UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, joined governments and central banks around the world in announcing emergency economic packages and safety measures, to contain the spread of the coronavirus and soften the impact on their economies.

The virus, which has its roots in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 278,000 people and at least 11,570 have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Italy, Spain and Iran are among the worst hit countries outside of China, as nations across Europe, Middle East and North America close borders and implement travel restrictions.

The relief measures from conventional banks including Emirates NBD, Mashreq and Commercial Bank of Dubai extend to the lenders’ retail, business and small and medium-sized enterprises clientele.

Retail loan customers placed on unpaid leave by their employers can approach the banks for repayment holidays of up to three months with zero interest and fees. Those who have taken out personal loans, auto loans or mortgages can apply for a one-month repayment holiday with no fees.

For mortgage clients, the banks are offering all first time homebuyers a 5 per cent increase in the Loan-to-Value ratio (LTV) and full waiver of processing fees. Customers will also be able to get a refund of charges on cash withdrawals using debit cards on ATMs of other banks across the UAE.

Credit card customers will be allowed interest-free installment plans for all school fee payments as well as grocery purchases with no processing fees for up to six months.

Customers who cancel their travel bookings done through credit and debit cards will receive refund of the foreign currency transaction fees already charged by the bank. Customers using credit cards for cash withdrawals will have to pay half cash advance charges.

“We fully recognise the importance of assisting our customers, businesses and communities in these challenging times through these relief measures and we place the highest priority on ensuring the welfare and happiness of the society and all those living in the country,” said Abdul Al Ghurair, chairman of Mashreq Bank.

Dubai lenders are also offering their SME clients, who have availed merchant , equipment or business vehicle loans, an option to apply for a repayment holiday of three months with zero interest and fees.

The lenders have also reduced the monthly minimum balance required for basic business banking account to Dh10,000 and have waived the minimum balance charges for three months .

For wholesale banking, lenders are prioritising relief measures for key industry sectors contributing to the UAE economy that have been most affected in the current situation, including health care, aviation, hospitality, retail, event management, consumer goods and education, by offering refinancing, repayment deferrals or lower repayments where required, it added.

“In accordance with this announcement, banks will show more flexibility to stressed customers during this difficult time and support its retail, SME and corporate customers through several specific initiatives targeted at reducing their financial burdens,” Mr Al Ghurair said.

Reduced bank charges for digital trade transactions all trade finance customers and enhanced credit and trade lines are also on offer. Customers trading in the UAE stock markets have also been offered “suitable instalment payment plans” against additional collateral to help them regularise their margin trading positions, the Dubai government said.

Dubai Islamic Bank and Emirates Islamic are providing most of the retail banking facilities offered by their conventional banking peers to their customers.

The two Sharia-compliant lenders are also offering financially impacted customers option to apply for debt consolidation solutions where appropriate. The lenders will also work with the customers facing margin calls on their shares portfolio.

The lenders have asked their business, wholesale and priority banking customers to contact their relationship managers to find the best solutions to ease their financial burden during the crisis.

“In these unprecedented times, strong and decisive actions are critical to sustain the economy,” said Mohammed Al Shaibani, director general of the Ruler’s Court of Dubai and chairman of DIB .

The bank has taken steps to “ensure both physical and financial health and security of our entire client base”, he added.

13,rakbank,03-05-2020,"The National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah (RAKBank) reported a 43 per cent drop in first-quarter net profit on higher provisions for expected loan losses as a coronavirus-linked economic slowdown ensues.

Net profit attributable to owners of the bank for the three months ending March 31 declined to Dh153 million, the lender said in a statement to the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, where its shares trade. Profit for the period fell “due to higher IFRS 9 provisions that are set as precautionary measures to combat the economic impact of the novel coronavirus"", the lender said.

Net provision for credit loss climbed 39 per cent year-on-year to Dh480.4m. Net interest income and net income from Islamic financing also rose almost 2 per cent to Dh696m, while non-interest income dropped 4 per cent to Dh305m during the period.

“Like most banks globally we have taken the pre-emptive judgemental overlays in our IFRS 9 provisions to factor in the challenges that lie ahead, which has led to additional provisions of just over Dh130m for the quarter,” RAKBank chief executive Peter England said in a statement.

“RAKBank is very well positioned to weather the current challenges with very high levels of capital, liquidity and precautionary provisions, leaving us in a very strong position to help our clients through these very challenging times.”

General and administrative expenses of the bank dropped 4.49 per cent year-on-year to Dh367.2m.

Total assets at the end of the first quarter grew 4.6 per cent to Dh59.8bn, but loans and advances dropped almost 1 per cent from the end of the last year to Dh34.3bn. Customer deposits increased 3 per cent to Dh37.8bn during the first three months of 2020.

Lenders worldwide are facing a decline in profitability as loan growth slows and interest rates fall as central banks embark on monetary easing measures to support their economies.

The global economy is facing its deepest recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s and is projected to shrink 3 per cent in 2020, the International Monetary Fund said last month. The outlook is worse than the 2008 financial crisis and the IMF does not expect a recovery to take place before 2021.

The UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, has rolled out Dh282bn in fiscal and monetary support, including a Dh256bn package of measures from the central bank, which has provided zero interest funding to banks to encourage lending growth, as well as relaxing capital and liquidity buffers. Other government initiatives range from discounted utility bills to postponement and waivers of various fees.

“We are continuously monitoring the developments of Covid-19 and are always prepared to support our customers facing financial hardship or loss of income due to its economic impact on individuals, SMEs and corporates, including elimination or reduction of many fees and rates,” Mr England added.

“These measures were made possible with the support of the Central Bank of the UAE’s financial stimulus packages that directly benefitted customers by relieving them of their financial burdens during the health crisis.”","The National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah (RAKBank) reported a 43 per cent drop in first-quarter net profit on higher provisions for expected loan losses as a coronavirus-linked economic slowdown ensues.

14,rakbank,29-04-2020,"As business slowed before grinding to a halt at the end of March, Payal Mirchandani, the chief executive of Pinca Trading, watched as orders and payments dried up from the large retailers that buy from her.

She slashed the annual sales forecast for her business, which distributes toys and other children's products, while fielding emails and calls from retailers that wanted to extend payment terms, from 60 to 100 days. Then she turned to her banks for relief.

Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest ... Payal Mirchandani, Pinca Trading

Mashreq Bank, where she has a secured business loan, offered her a three-month payment holiday – a process she describes as quick and “pretty seamless”. Interest will still accrue during this period, but will be charged on the final payments. “Of course it would be great if they didn’t charge the interest at all, but I think it’s fair, and it’s still a support,” says Ms Mirchandani, from Canada who lives in Dubai.

RAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday. “They did their due diligence – they asked us a lot of questions, they wanted us to submit a lot documents. But they were supportive at the end, given that we could prove we had been affected,"" she says.

“Because we are a distributor selling to retailers, it’s a no-brainer – retailers were shut across the country.”

Ms Mirchandani says she breathed a sigh of relief when her banks said yes. “Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest, I’m just grateful that I got it at the time that I did,"" she adds.

Borrowers across the country have benefited from loan relief from their banks, driven by the UAE Central Bank’s Dh50 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess), part of a Dh100bn package launched on March 14. The overall size of the stimulus was later increased to Dh256bn and by April 23, banks had allocated over 60 per cent of the Dh50bn Tess package, which equates to Dh30bn.

Personal loans

For some residents, the process of applying for debt relief has been very smooth. Omar Youssef works for Orora, an events company in Dubai, which has seen most of its business dry up during Covid-19 apart from its animation studio and work on digital campaigns.

He called HSBC where he has a personal loan and is a priority banking customer and asked for a payment holiday. Due to his 33 per cent salary reduction, the bank offered him a loan holiday of up to three months, without interest or fees, though he has to sign a document each month requesting the payment holiday for an additional month and attesting his income remains reduced.

“It was a very easy procedure,"" he says. ""They send you an online form to complete and sign, and attach the company letter saying you have a salary reduction.""

Dan Robinson, head of wealth and personal banking at HSBC UAE, said: ""Our customers have told us where they need our support most and we have made those areas our focus.""

Mr Youssef says some of his friends, who have had their incomes affected by Covid-19, did not apply for loan holidays because they thought it would be drawn-out process. “When I saw how easy it was I called my friend and told him he should do it as well,"" he says.

Most financial relief measures are broadly similar across banks in the country, says Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of the financial comparison website Souqalmal.com. Borrowers who have been financially affected by the pandemic and the resulting movement restrictions have access to penalty-free payment holidays on loans for up to three months, and interest-free instalment plans of up to six months on grocery purchases, school fee payments and utility bill payments made with credit cards, she says.

“Foreign banks have also introduced various financial relief measures, though these vary in structure and scale across individual banks,” Ms Musa adds.

Home loans

Mortgage payments are often the biggest single cost faced by home owners and therefore relief from these can ease a significant financial burden.

Natasha Hatherall-Shawe, who owns a marketing, PR and events agency in Dubai, says “overnight” the business lost around 70 per cent of its revenue, as well as facing a slowdown in client payments.

“It leaves our company cash flow in a very difficult place and I have 20 staff to pay and my priority is to make sure they are paid and OK,"" says the Briton, who lives in Dubai. ""All of my savings and personal money will go into filling the gap left from reduced revenue and clients not paying.""

She received a one-month holiday on her home mortgage with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, though interest will continue to accrue. She was advised by her bank that the remaining loan tenure may increase as an effect of the deferment, while service fees for the request were waived.

Ms Hatherall-Shawe says her bank has been responsive and helpful. ""I was disappointed at one month initially, but they [then said] that they did offer up more potentially if I met the criteria,"" she says. ""Given the nature of my business and the fact we are unlikely to get anywhere back to normal until September onwards, I am likely to apply.”

The process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straight forward, according to Arran Summerhill, director of Holo, a mortgage broker in Dubai. Banks typically want to receive an email detailing how the coronavirus has affected a borrower economically, including evidence such as a salary reduction letter, he says.

“We’ve tried with six different banks now. We’ve not had a bank that has come back and actually declined a client’s request,” he says.

Clients that have been able to secure deferments include a landlord with multiple units, who was able to receive a loan holiday from the bank partly because his tenants were telling him they were struggling to meet monthly rent payments.

Mortgage broker Arran Summerhill says the process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straightforward. Pawan Singh / The National

Mr Summerhill, says the impact of a job loss or salary reduction will often be greater on a household than a landlord, who can be expected to have multiple revenue streams.

“We’ve had households who reached out to their lenders and they seem to be very grateful for the fact it’s been a fairly smooth process for the banks to agree these payment delays,” he says.

Haresh Lalwani, managing director at Right Move Mortgage Broker, believes it’s logical for banks to try to provide relief for borrowers at this time and says it is positive for a brand if a lender is proactive.

“People remember which bank supported them during the tough times,"" he says. ""So definitely, it’s a huge plus for them.”

Mr Lalwani benefited himself from a rent relief when his landlord, Sultan bin Ali Al Owais Real Estate. announced a 45-day rent waiver for its tenants at the end of March.

Credit cards

While relief on rents or loans is commonplace, the situation for credit card debt is also more variable, with some banks offering repayment holidays and others not.

Ms Musa says some banks are offering credit card customers the option to postpone their repayments by one month, with deferred interest, while other banks have also reduced their late payment fees on credit cards.

Cardholders may also be able to benefit from 0 per cent interest deals on balance transfers, she says. “Some banks are offering this interest-free deal for up to 12 months, making it a great way for cardholders to repay and settle their outstanding credit card debt faster,"" she adds.

Commercial Bank of Dubai (CBD) is offering a one-month payment holiday for all customers on credit cards and other loans. Customers affected by Covid-19 can also defer their instalments for up to three months.

So far CBD has helped 3,000 customers in the UAE, says Amit Malhotra, general manager, personal banking group. “We are one of the lead banks in the Dubai banks combined relief measures package offer, and we have also undertaken several other initiatives to support our customers during the current coronavirus pandemic,” he says.

Mashreq is also offering a payment holiday of up to three months with no extra fees or charges to “a sizeable number” of the bank’s credit card, home loan and personal loan customers, though current interest rates apply. The banks says it reaching out to these customers directly.

Not all debtors can secure relief from the banks, however. Borrowers who already defaulted on their loans before the crisis are not eligible for financial relief measures such as repayment holidays, despite the financial effects of the crisis worsening their situation, says Ms Musa. Non-residents do not qualify for relief either.

“It is best for such borrowers to approach their bank to see what debt relief options are available to them, and whether the bank can restructure their debts to make repayments more manageable,” she adds.","RAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday.

15,rakbank,06-04-2020,"Publicly listed companies were asked by UAE market regulators to outline their exposure to NMC Health – the country’s biggest healthcare operator which looks set to be placed into administration at a UK High Court hearing today.

Given the ties between the company, which was founded by BR Shetty in 1975, and Finablr – in which Mr Shetty retains a majority stake – companies were also asked to declare any exposure to that group, and to its largest local entity, UAE Exchange.

Banks have the greatest exposure, having extended loans and invested in sukuk worth more than Dh10 billion. Banks from other Gulf states have also begun reporting their exposure.

But insurers and other companies have also declared investments and other relationships, including money that is owed to NMC Health.

16,rakbank,06-04-2020,"UAE banks revealed a combined exposure of at least Dh8bn to NMC Health on Sunday, rising to Dh9.5bn when amounts also owed to founder BR Shetty’s Finablr group and its subsidiary UAE Exchange are added in.

Stockmarket-listed companies disclosed their exposure to the companies following the news that Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank is looking to appoint administrators to NMC Health, which is the country’s biggest private healthcare operator.

ADCB declared that it has exposure to NMC Health worth $981 million (Dh3.6 billion), as well as $182m to Finablr and its subsidiaries.

“The combined liabilities of NMC Health Group and the Finablr Group to ADCB Group represent circa 1 per cent of ADCB Group’s total assets,” the lender said in a statement to the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, where its shares trade.

Dubai Islamic Bank said it is owed $425m by NMC Health, and that Noor Bank, which it acquired in January, is owed $116m. Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank is owed $291.4m, and has a $31m investment in an NMC Health sukuk.

Dubai’s biggest lender, Emirates NBD, is owed Dh747.3 million – most of which is due to Emirates Islamic Bank. Commercial Bank International said it is owed Dh425.6m by the three companies, but did not give a breakdown as to where its exposure lay. National Bank of Fujairah is owed Dh289.1m by the three companies, but only Dh12.9m of this is owed by NMC Health. The healthcare giant also owes Dh151.9m to Ajman Bank, Dh135.3m to United Arab Bank and has Dh100.2m in working capital facilities with RAKBank.

ADCB said in a statement on Saturday it is looking to appoint administrators to “safeguard the future of NMC Health and its subsidiaries”, arguing that its requests for greater transparency had been ignored by the company.

NMC Health’s executive chairman Faisal Belhoul asked lenders on Sunday to agree to a standstill on its debts, arguing that putting it into administration would create “additional pressure on the group’s liquidity”.

NMC Health has debts of about $6.6bn, according to a recent filing, which it owes to a group of more than 80 local, regional and international lenders.

17,rakbank,05-04-2020,"The UAE’s publicly-listed companies began reporting their exposure to NMC Health, the embattled healthcare operator, which is at risk of being placed into administration.

As of Sunday, banks in the UAE had declared a combined exposure of about Dh8.04 billion ($2.16bn) in the form of loans to the group and its subsidiaries.

Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, the company’s biggest individual lender, is owed $981 million, it said in a statement to the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange last week. ADCB on Saturday said it has approached the UK's High Court to place NMC Health into administration “to protecting its interest and assuring the long-term sustainability of the company”.

Dubai Islamic Bank, the largest Sharia-compliant lender in the UAE, said it is owed $425m. It also said Noor Bank, which it acquired in January, has a loan exposure of $116m.

“The bank has been monitoring recent developments at the [NMC] group. In conjunction with other substantial creditors, the bank is now in discussions with the group and its advisers to ascertain the group’s financial position and identify potential measures to address the group’s governance and financial issues,” DIB said in a statement to the Dubai Financial Market, where its shares trade.

The lender said it is “taking appropriate actions to protect its interests and fully appreciates the vital role that the group’s healthcare services play in our local communities, particularly at this time”.

Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank reported loan exposure of $291.4m to the healthcare company, and said it had a $31m investment in a sukuk issued by the company. Reem Investments also declared a $1m investment in NMC Health's sukuk.

Dubai's largest lender, Emirates NBD, reported Dh747.34m, including Dh676.46m to Emirates Islamic Bank. Khaleeji Commercial Bank said it is owed $30m by the healthcare firm.

Ajman Bank declared an exposure of Dh151.9m to NMC, while United Arab Bank reported total exposure of Dh135.3m. The National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah, RAKBank, said it is owed Dh100.2m, Sharjah Islamic Bank is owed Dh29.6m and Mashreq Bank said it is owed Dh502,598 from subsidiary New Medical Centre Training.

An equities fund controlled by the bank, Makaseb Arab Tigers Fund, also holds 25,000 shares in the company.

Al Salam Bank revealed a transaction where it had offloaded some shares, but it retains a direct stake of about 4.9 per cent in NMC and an indirect stake of just below 3 per cent.

Aramex, the largest courier company in the Middle East, said it is owed about Dh335,000 by NMC and UAE Exchange, which was also founded by NMC’s founder, B R Shetty, and is owned by Finablr, a listed London entity in which Mr Shetty retains a majority stake.

Regulators asked listed firms to declare their exposure to NMC Health, UAE Exchange (whose operations are being overseen by the Central Bank of the UAE) and Finablr.

ADCB said it is owed a further $182m by Finablr Group and its subsidiaries, including UAE Exchange.

Commercial Bank International declared Dh425.6m to NMC Health, Finablr and UAE Exchange, but it did not break down how much it was owed by each company.

National Bank of Fujairah put its total exposure to the three entities at Dh289.1m, with the bulk of this (Dh276.2m) owed by Finablr group and its subsidiaries.

Umm Al Qaiwain-based bank NBQ said it is owed Dh50m by UAE Exchange

NMC Health’s new chairman Faisal Belhoul has requested lenders enter into a standstill agreement on the company’s debt, and said placing the company in administration ""would cause instability to the operating businesses of the NMC Group, creating additional pressure on the group’s liquidity and reducing value for all creditors”.

""This would be damaging not only to the interests of creditors but, in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, would potentially put lives at risk,” said Mr Belhoul, whose private equity company Ithmar Capital acquired a 9 per cent stake in the business in late March.

He also pledged the company would be more transparent and put stronger governance structures in place.

ADCB, however, said it is seeking the appointment of administrators to “safeguard the future of NMC Health and its subsidiaries”, arguing that its requests for greater transparency to date had been ignored by the company.

It served notice of its intention to apply to the High Court to place the company into administration on Friday, saying the joint administrators appointed would launch a “full, transparent and independent investigation” into the company’s affairs.

NMC Health is understood to have exposure to more than 80 local, regional and international financial institutions, according to the filings of ADCB and DIB.

The company was forced to make a series of damaging disclosures in the last few months after a report by activist investor Muddy Waters in December, which alleged it had inflated cash balances, overpaid for its assets and understated its debt.

Last month, it said its debt stood at $6.6bn (Dh24.24bn), substantially higher than the $2.1bn declared in its last filed accounts. A review committee also discovered evidence of “suspected fraudulent behaviour”.

Two joint chairmen, including the company’s founder, an executive vice-chairman, a chief executive, a chief financial officer and a member of its treasury team have all resigned from the business.

18,rakbank,05-04-2020,"As stock market volatility looks set to continue for some time, investors can be forgiven for wanting to flee the carnage and hide their money in the safest possible haven.

In chaotic times like these, traditional stores of value such as bonds, gold and cash often come into their own, by shielding investors from the worst of the meltdown.

However, both gold and bonds have performed erratically in recent weeks, while returns on cash are plunging even lower, amid a flurry of global interest rate cuts.

Before the coronavirus crisis struck, some cryptocurrency fans argued that Bitcoin also offers protection, but it has subsequently fallen even faster than shares.

So which of these safe havens, if any, should you be racing to right now?

Government bonds

US government bonds, or Treasuries, are one of the lowest-risk investments in the world.

They are issued by the US Department of the Treasury to finance government spending, and it pledges to raise money by any means legally available to repay them. No wonder investors rush to buy them in a crisis.

After wild swings in March, US Treasuries have now justified their safe haven status again. Michael Bolliger, UBS Global Wealth Management

Michael Bolliger, analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, says US Treasuries also benefit from being issued in the world's reserve currency.

Despite these advantages, bonds were incredibly volatile in March. While prices initially went up as stock markets fell, they then fell as panicky traders dumped long-term bonds because they anticipated a surge in the supply of newly issued debt, which would drive down prices.

Bond traders later calmed down after the Senate approved a massive $2 trillion (Dh7.34tn) economic relief package. “After wild swings in March, US Treasuries have now justified their safe haven status again,” Mr Bolliger says.

When bonds are in demand, prices rise, but yields fall. On Friday, the yield on a 10-year US Treasury fell to just 0.59 per cent. If you invest in a 30-year Treasury, you get only slightly more at 1.23 per cent.

US Treasuries are safe, but you pay a high price for that kind of security these days.

To get exposure, USD Treasury Bond UCITS ETF (VDTY), which invests 100 per cent in US Treasuries, currently yields 2.06 per cent. It boasts an impressive year-to-date return of 8.91 per cent, or 14.69 per cent over 12 months, according to Bloomberg.

Gold

Gold is the oldest store of value but its price also fell in March, as fund managers took profits and used the money to cover losses elsewhere, meet customer redemptions or buy shares at reduced prices.

The gold price is nonetheless up a punchy 26.74 per cent over the last year, according to Goldprice.org. Carsten Menke, head of next generation research at Julius Baer, says its safe haven status holds good. “As the global recession unfolds, we still see more upside for gold,” he adds.

Gold is still some way off its all-time high price of $1,895 per ounce, which it hit during the eurozone crisis in September 2011.

At the time of writing, it trades at $1,618, and Mr Menke says it will only top its previous record if the crisis “moves out of hand and the expected short and sharp recession turns into a longer-lasting depression”.

Professor Stephen Thomas, associate dean, MBA Programmes at Cass Business School in Dubai and London, says gold has enjoyed a fantastic 12 months, along with US bonds, proving the importance of having a diversified portfolio. “The gold price certainly isn't going to collapse in the current environment, when shares are impossible to value.”

The danger comes when markets recover, as the gold price could slip back, but there seems little danger of that right now.

Perhaps the easiest way to invest in gold is through an exchange traded fund. WisdomTree Physical Gold (PHAU) is up 6.07 per cent so far in 2020 and 24.74 per cent over 12 months, according to Bloomberg, while iShares Physical Gold (SGLN) is up 14.35 per cent and 34.20 per cent over the same period.

Cash

Cash has been out of favour since interest rates were slashed to near zero during the global financial crisis of 2008.

Last month, the US Federal Reserve cut its already-low benchmark interest rate to zero in repsonse to the current crisis, but Mr Thomas says that is the least of people's worries right now. “Cash has been underappreciated for too long. In today's low inflation world, it might be a hidden gem in your portfolio,” he adds.

Cash is safe but just remember that it will not completely protect your capital, as inflation may erode its value in real terms.

Mr Bolliger at UBS says in the longer run, you need your money to work harder than it will sitting in cash. “Money markets yield little to nothing, and even with inflation rates rather low, cash holdings offer negative real expected returns.”

However, amid today’s extreme volatility, many investors will still appreciate the comfort that cash offers.

To get exposure, a search on comparison site Souqalmal.com shows HSBC eSaver pays up to 1.5 per cent in interest, Emirates Smart Saver Account pays 1.5 per cent, RAKBank Fast Saver pays 1.75 per cent and ADCB Active Saver Account up to 2 per cent. The interest rate you receive depends on factors such as how much you save and in which currency.

Bitcoin

Before Covid-19, fans of cryptocurrencies started to circulate the theory that Bitcoin was now a safe bolthole in a crisis. The last month has proved them wrong.

On February 12, Bitcoin traded at $10,350. Exactly one month later, as coronavirus swept the West, its price had slumped to $4,857 as panicky investors fled risky assets in a rush to raise cash ahead of an expected liquidity crunch. It has recovered slightly to $6,720, but as Vijay Valecha, chief investment officer at Century Financial, notes: “Bitcoin has actually been the biggest loser in this crash, falling 70 per cent as traders and investors shifted into cash.”

The cryptocurrency is a speculative and highly volatile investment, making it a poor safe haven, Mr Valecha says. “Bitcoin may be more erratic than ever amid the current volatility.”

Mr Bolliger says: “We do not consider Bitcoin as an investment vehicle, and would recommend investors not to see cryptocurrencies as a safe haven asset.”

Stay diversified

As bonds and gold have both demonstrated, even safer asset classes can fall, but Mr Valecha says their recent minor correction may be healthy because both were in danger of becoming too expensive. They now look more attractive at today's slightly lower price.

Maurice Gravier, chief investment officer at Emirates NBD, says whatever happens in the stock market, one thing never changes: “The absolute golden rule in investment is diversification.”

Every investor should build a balanced portfolio that includes shares, bonds, gold, property and cash. So if one asset plunges, the others may compensate by holding firm or rising.

The balance you hold will reflect personal factors such as your age, and attitude to risk.

Mr Gravier says even safe havens can crumble if investors rush into cash to reduce or cover their losses. “This extreme correlation is generally temporary, so if anything it can be an opportunity,” he says.

Along with diversification, time is your best defence. Whether buying risky assets like shares, or safer options such as bonds and gold, you should aim to hold for the long term. ""Avoid being a forced seller at the worst possible time, and having to take your losses,"" says Mr Gravier.

Panic episodes like this one are a good opportunity to buy assets you are underexposed to, he says.

Currently, he is neutral on gold, relatively overweight in cash and underweight in bonds. “We are always ready to adjust,” Mr Gravier adds.","So which of these safe havens, if any, should you be racing to right now?

19,rakbank,25-03-2020,"As the coronavirus outbreak and measures to contain it cause economic ramifications across the globe, banks and regulators are stepping in to provide financial relief for retail customers and businesses.

We recognise the need to protect those most vulnerable and are committed to lending a helping hand during this uncertain time. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, Emirates NBD

Under a Dh100 billion economic stimulus package unveiled by the UAE Central Bank on March 14, lenders in the Emirates were ordered to “treat all their customers fairly” and grant “temporary relief"" on retail clients’ loan payments for up to six months from March 15.

The Targeted Economic Support Scheme includes Dh50bn from central bank funds through collateralised loans at zero cost to all banks operating in the UAE and Dh50bn of funds freed from banks’ capital buffers.

Emirates NBD, the biggest bank by assets in Dubai, along with the UAE’s largest Sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates Islamic, Mashreq and Commercial Bank of Dubai announced a series of support measures that will remain in effect for three months starting April 1, the Dubai government media office said on March 21.

In Abu Dhabi, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank are offering support measures for customers. The three banks have introduced 17 initiatives to support individuals and businesses, the Abu Dhabi media office said in a tweet on Wednesday.

Elsewhere in the UAE, Ras al Khaimah's RAKBank, Sharjah Islamic Bank and Commercial Bank International – which is based in Dubai and listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange – have also pledged to help customers.

Worldwide, there are over 425,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with more than 18,900 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins as of Wednesday. More than 109,000 have recovered. In the UAE, there are more than 240 cases with two deaths and 45 recoveries.

Containment measures in the UAE, such as stay-at-home directives and cancelled flights, could cause a decline in revenue for businesses, and a cut in income or job losses for individuals.

“At a time like this, ensuring the UAE's banking system's stability is of utmost importance,” said Ambareen Musa, chief executive of souqalmal.com. “It's great to see banks step up and support the government and the central bank’s economic relief efforts.”

Some banks have even set up dedicated phone lines and email accounts to offer support to retail and business customers who have been financially affected by the Covid-19 crisis, Ms Musa said.

Even when there aren’t specific clauses that address your individual situation, banks are offering refinancing, repayment deferrals or lower repayments where required.

“We recognise the need to protect those most vulnerable and are committed to lending a helping hand during this uncertain time,” said Emirates NBD chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed.

Bank branches outside shopping malls will remain open for now and ATM services are operational, but the central bank has urged customers to use digital and online channels as much as possible.

Here we outline how banks are helping consumers and businesses weather the storm.

RAKBank

RAKBank unveiled measures to support individuals, SMEs and corporates affected by the outbreak on Tuesday, effective immediately.

The bank said it will work with clients on a case-by-case basis to provide flexible solutions to manage challenges such as pay disruption or illness from the virus.

Individual customers:

A three-month payment holiday on car and personal loans applies, as well as a one-month payment holiday on credit card payments. The bank is offering a one-time discount of up to 50 per cent on overdue transaction fees. Customers can convert education and electronic spending on their credit cards into an Easy Payment Plan at 0 per cent interest and zero processing fees for up to 24 months.

Business customers:

RAKBank is reducing its SME Prime lending rate and offering payment holidays for business loans or asset-backed loans for a period of up to six months. It is offering the RAKstarter zero balance current account to start-ups and new entrepreneurs.

The bank’s Simplify platform will waive monthly fees over the next three months to businesses that offer essential services, such as medicines and groceries.

Sharjah Islamic Bank

Sharjah Islamic Bank rolled out relief measures on Tuesday, effective from April 1.

Individual customers:

Similar measures apply. Any retail customer who has been made redundant or failed to receive their salary due to the current economic conditions can request to defer instalments for three months at no charge. Payments on real estate loans can be deferred for one month.

To reduce or eliminate the need to visit branches, the bank increased the daily withdrawal limit from ATMs to Dh15,000 for individual clients and Dh25,000 for priority banking clients.

Business customers:

The bank reduced the minimum account balance to Dh10,000. It “invites corporate clients to contact their relationship managers to discuss the available options” to help them mitigate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on their business, the bank said.","In Abu Dhabi, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank are offering support measures for customers.

20,hsbc,29-04-2020,"As business slowed before grinding to a halt at the end of March, Payal Mirchandani, the chief executive of Pinca Trading, watched as orders and payments dried up from the large retailers that buy from her.

She slashed the annual sales forecast for her business, which distributes toys and other children's products, while fielding emails and calls from retailers that wanted to extend payment terms, from 60 to 100 days. Then she turned to her banks for relief.

Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest ... Payal Mirchandani, Pinca Trading

Mashreq Bank, where she has a secured business loan, offered her a three-month payment holiday – a process she describes as quick and “pretty seamless”. Interest will still accrue during this period, but will be charged on the final payments. “Of course it would be great if they didn’t charge the interest at all, but I think it’s fair, and it’s still a support,” says Ms Mirchandani, from Canada who lives in Dubai.

RAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday. “They did their due diligence – they asked us a lot of questions, they wanted us to submit a lot documents. But they were supportive at the end, given that we could prove we had been affected,"" she says.

“Because we are a distributor selling to retailers, it’s a no-brainer – retailers were shut across the country.”

Ms Mirchandani says she breathed a sigh of relief when her banks said yes. “Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest, I’m just grateful that I got it at the time that I did,"" she adds.

Borrowers across the country have benefited from loan relief from their banks, driven by the UAE Central Bank’s Dh50 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess), part of a Dh100bn package launched on March 14. The overall size of the stimulus was later increased to Dh256bn and by April 23, banks had allocated over 60 per cent of the Dh50bn Tess package, which equates to Dh30bn.

Personal loans

For some residents, the process of applying for debt relief has been very smooth. Omar Youssef works for Orora, an events company in Dubai, which has seen most of its business dry up during Covid-19 apart from its animation studio and work on digital campaigns.

He called HSBC where he has a personal loan and is a priority banking customer and asked for a payment holiday. Due to his 33 per cent salary reduction, the bank offered him a loan holiday of up to three months, without interest or fees, though he has to sign a document each month requesting the payment holiday for an additional month and attesting his income remains reduced.

“It was a very easy procedure,"" he says. ""They send you an online form to complete and sign, and attach the company letter saying you have a salary reduction.""

Dan Robinson, head of wealth and personal banking at HSBC UAE, said: ""Our customers have told us where they need our support most and we have made those areas our focus.""

Mr Youssef says some of his friends, who have had their incomes affected by Covid-19, did not apply for loan holidays because they thought it would be drawn-out process. “When I saw how easy it was I called my friend and told him he should do it as well,"" he says.

Most financial relief measures are broadly similar across banks in the country, says Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of the financial comparison website Souqalmal.com. Borrowers who have been financially affected by the pandemic and the resulting movement restrictions have access to penalty-free payment holidays on loans for up to three months, and interest-free instalment plans of up to six months on grocery purchases, school fee payments and utility bill payments made with credit cards, she says.

“Foreign banks have also introduced various financial relief measures, though these vary in structure and scale across individual banks,” Ms Musa adds.

Home loans

Mortgage payments are often the biggest single cost faced by home owners and therefore relief from these can ease a significant financial burden.

Natasha Hatherall-Shawe, who owns a marketing, PR and events agency in Dubai, says “overnight” the business lost around 70 per cent of its revenue, as well as facing a slowdown in client payments.

“It leaves our company cash flow in a very difficult place and I have 20 staff to pay and my priority is to make sure they are paid and OK,"" says the Briton, who lives in Dubai. ""All of my savings and personal money will go into filling the gap left from reduced revenue and clients not paying.""

She received a one-month holiday on her home mortgage with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, though interest will continue to accrue. She was advised by her bank that the remaining loan tenure may increase as an effect of the deferment, while service fees for the request were waived.

Ms Hatherall-Shawe says her bank has been responsive and helpful. ""I was disappointed at one month initially, but they [then said] that they did offer up more potentially if I met the criteria,"" she says. ""Given the nature of my business and the fact we are unlikely to get anywhere back to normal until September onwards, I am likely to apply.”

The process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straight forward, according to Arran Summerhill, director of Holo, a mortgage broker in Dubai. Banks typically want to receive an email detailing how the coronavirus has affected a borrower economically, including evidence such as a salary reduction letter, he says.

“We’ve tried with six different banks now. We’ve not had a bank that has come back and actually declined a client’s request,” he says.

Clients that have been able to secure deferments include a landlord with multiple units, who was able to receive a loan holiday from the bank partly because his tenants were telling him they were struggling to meet monthly rent payments.

Mr Summerhill, says the impact of a job loss or salary reduction will often be greater on a household than a landlord, who can be expected to have multiple revenue streams.

“We’ve had households who reached out to their lenders and they seem to be very grateful for the fact it’s been a fairly smooth process for the banks to agree these payment delays,” he says.

Haresh Lalwani, managing director at Right Move Mortgage Broker, believes it’s logical for banks to try to provide relief for borrowers at this time and says it is positive for a brand if a lender is proactive.

“People remember which bank supported them during the tough times,"" he says. ""So definitely, it’s a huge plus for them.”

Mr Lalwani benefited himself from a rent relief when his landlord, Sultan bin Ali Al Owais Real Estate. announced a 45-day rent waiver for its tenants at the end of March.

Credit cards

While relief on rents or loans is commonplace, the situation for credit card debt is also more variable, with some banks offering repayment holidays and others not.

Ms Musa says some banks are offering credit card customers the option to postpone their repayments by one month, with deferred interest, while other banks have also reduced their late payment fees on credit cards.

Cardholders may also be able to benefit from 0 per cent interest deals on balance transfers, she says. “Some banks are offering this interest-free deal for up to 12 months, making it a great way for cardholders to repay and settle their outstanding credit card debt faster,"" she adds.

Commercial Bank of Dubai (CBD) is offering a one-month payment holiday for all customers on credit cards and other loans. Customers affected by Covid-19 can also defer their instalments for up to three months.

So far CBD has helped 3,000 customers in the UAE, says Amit Malhotra, general manager, personal banking group. “We are one of the lead banks in the Dubai banks combined relief measures package offer, and we have also undertaken several other initiatives to support our customers during the current coronavirus pandemic,” he says.

Mashreq is also offering a payment holiday of up to three months with no extra fees or charges to “a sizeable number” of the bank’s credit card, home loan and personal loan customers, though current interest rates apply. The banks says it reaching out to these customers directly.

Not all debtors can secure relief from the banks, however. Borrowers who already defaulted on their loans before the crisis are not eligible for financial relief measures such as repayment holidays, despite the financial effects of the crisis worsening their situation, says Ms Musa. Non-residents do not qualify for relief either.

“It is best for such borrowers to approach their bank to see what debt relief options are available to them, and whether the bank can restructure their debts to make repayments more manageable,” she adds.","RAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday.

21,hsbc,28-04-2020,"HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, warned of a further decline in earnings and a rise in loan losses as the lender set aside $3 billion (Dh11bn) for bad debts after its first quarter profit almost halved amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The bank‘s reported profit before tax slumped 48 per cent to $3.2bn, lower than the average analyst forecast of $3.7bn compiled by the bank. Higher than expected loan losses and lower revenue dragged down the quarterly profitability, the bank said in a statement on Tuesday.

Reported revenue declined 5 per cent to $13.7bn, partly impacted by adverse valuation adjustments in its global banking and markets business.

HSBC said it expects “materially lower profitability” in 2020 and will focus on reducing operating expenses to mitigate a fall in revenue.

Expected credit losses rose by a hefty $2.3bn to $3bn at the end of March due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and weakening oil prices. A significant charge related to a corporate exposure in Singapore inflated impairment allowances, the lender said without naming the company.

Loan losses this year could swell to between $7bn and $11bn, “depending on sensitivity analysis”, it noted.

""The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our customers has been the main driver of the change in our financial performance since the turn of the year,” Noel Quinn, group chief executive of HSBC, said. “The resultant increase in expected credit losses in the first quarter contributed to a material fall in reported profit before tax.”

Lenders across the world are facing a decline in profitability as revenue shrinks amid historically low interest rates and expected loan losses rise as the pandemic disrupts the global economy.

JPMorgan Chase, America's largest bank, last week reported a 69 per cent drop in first quarter profit, as it set aside $8.3bn for loan loss provisions. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup have also posted their highest provisions in decades as non-performing debt continues to rise.

The lockdowns across the world to curtail the coronavirus outbreak has pushed the global economy into the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The International Monetary Fund earlier this month projected a 3 per cent contraction in global output for 2020, noting the global economic outlook this year is worse than the 2008 global economic crisis.

A sharp drop in oil prices has compounded economic woes. Brent, the benchmark for two-thirds of the world's oil, has slumped 77 per cent since the beginning of this year. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for US crude, on Tuesday slumped 13.07 per cent to trade at $11.11 per barrel for June delivery, reviving fears that it could plunge below sub-zero levels seen last week with its May contracts.

The pandemic has infected more than 3 million people globally and fatalities have topped 211,000 as of Tuesday. More than 894,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the spread of the disease. The rate of the spread of the outbreak, however, is slowing and countries in Asia and Europe and some states in the US have gradually starting opening up their economies.

The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our customers has been the main driver of the change in our financial performance since the turn of the year,” Noel Quinn, group chief executive of HSBC, said

HSBC said it will continue to assess the impact of the pandemic and review its financial performance and business plan accordingly.

“We will assess the appropriateness of our medium-term financial targets during that period and will review our dividend policy at, or ahead of, our year-end results for 2020.”

The Asia-focused bank, on the direction of financial regulators in the UK, scrapped its dividend plans, which pushed its shares in Hong Kong to an 11-year low this month.

HSBC has also paused a vast majority of 35,000 redundancies as part of its global transformation, which included cost cuts and the combining and closure of some businesses.

“We continue to press forward with the other areas of our transformation with the aim of delivering a stronger and leaner business that is better equipped to help our customers prosper in the recovery still to come,"" the bank said.","HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, warned of a further decline in earnings and a rise in loan losses as the lender set aside $3 billion (Dh11bn) for bad debts after its first quarter profit almost halved amid the coronavirus outbreak.

22,hsbc,22-04-2020,"The Dubai Financial Market, the only listed bourse in the GCC, on Wednesday launched the UAE Index for environment, social and governance (ESG), the first benchmark of its kind in the region that will gauge how responsible listed firms in the country are.

Developed in cooperation with S&P Dow Jones Indices and the Hawkamah Institute for corporate governance, the index is backed by the market regulator, the UAE Securities and Commodities Authority, the DFM said in a statement on Wednesday.

The move complements and supports SCA’s efforts in developing a supervisory regime that is in line with international best practices and promotes a culture of governance, Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansoori, the UAE's Minister of Economy and chairman of the SCA, said. The new index will enhance the confidence of investors in the UAE capital market, he added.

The S&P and Hawkamah UAE ESG index initially includes 20 listed companies and is based on five years of past performance. It is accessible through DFM’s website and other data dissemination platforms.

“The index provides a trusted and transparent tool that measures listed companies’ commitment to ESG,” Essa Kazim, chairman of the DFM, said.

“The appropriate implementation of best practices of corporate governance, disclosure and transparency as well as environmental and social commitment is essential to boost UAE markets’ competitiveness, attract further investments and sustain growth, noting that investment institutions across the world are increasingly factoring these matters in investment decisions process,” he added.

In February, Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange announced a tie-up with competing index provider FTSE Russell to provide a number of sector-specific indexes, as well as indexes of ESG and Sharia-compliant companies.

Tens of trillions of dollars are pouring into companies with robust ESG credentials globally, as investors move money out of businesses that are deemed to carry sustainability risks.

In an annual letter to investors in January, the chief executive of the world's biggest asset manager, Blackrock's Larry Fink, said the environment will be at the core of all new investments by the company. BlackRock, which manages about $7 trillion (Dh25.7tn) in assets, will look to exit investments that present a “high sustainability-related risk”, such as thermal coal producers, he said at the time.

Money managers across the world have faced criticism for not addressing climate change in their investment practices. An increasing number of investment firms are joining the Climate Action 100+ group that represents around $41tn in assets and includes more than 370 institutional investors, such as the asset management units of HSBC and UBS.

“There is no better time to encourage corporate responsible behaviours than now,” Ahmad Al Shaikh, chairman of Hawkamah, said. “The [DFM's] new ESG index will create good competition between listed companies to do the right thing, paying more attention to the environment, social and governance elements when managing their business.”","The Dubai Financial Market, the only listed bourse in the GCC, on Wednesday launched the UAE Index for environment, social and governance (ESG), the first benchmark of its kind in the region that will gauge how responsible listed firms in the country are.

23,hsbc,22-04-2020,"Even when the coronavirus pandemic recedes, Standard Chartered might suggest staff at its sprawling global operations keep staying at home.

“One thing is for sure - after this crisis is over we may have to rethink our work-from-home practices,” Jose Vinals, the London-based bank’s chairman, said in an interview. “The experience so far has been rather good. It may be that going forward you don’t need to have 100 per cent of the people in the office, 100 per cent of the time.”

Depending on the country, the crisis played out differently for office life. In Britain, where the bank is based but has no branch network, more than 98 per cent of staff are working from home, Mr Vinals said. In China, where authorities have started loosening restrictions, that figure falls to 30 per cent. All of its Chinese branches have reopened, including an outlet in Wuhan - the outbreak’s epicenter - that just opened a unit dedicated to small business.

Companies around the world have sent staff home as the pandemic prompted governments to halt the virus’s spread by enforcing lockdowns. In banking, working from home can be complicated by technological demands; on Wall Street, many staff have been sent home, but there have been tensions as some traders are urged to come to trading floors.

Mr Vinals said that overall, about 70 per cent of Standard Chartered’s 86,000-strong workforce was currently working from home. Its major hubs are Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. In Hong Kong, about 50 per cent of staff are now working from home, Mr Vinals said.

The bank’s Asian focus meant it had an earlier brush with Covid-19 than other British lenders. Its Hong Kong and Singapore staff were among the first to work from home. The bank has surveyed workers’ opinion of the shift, and says two-thirds reported a minor impact on their productivity or none at all from working at home, while 87 per cent felt able to support the needs of customers when working remotely.

“I can tell you, we are all going to be a lot more productive as a result of the experiences we have had,” Mr Vinals said. “If you had asked me three months ago what would happen if we had a shock like this, I don’t think I would have been as confident as I am now, having seen what I’ve seen.”

Those working from home have been told they cannot use the popular Zoom videoconferencing service. “We have some questions on the cyber-security features, and those questions have to be appropriately answered,” said Mr Vinals.

Standard Chartered will report first-quarter financial results next week. In February, before the pandemic severely impacted Europe, the lender warned that revenue and profitability targets would miss expectations.

As the crisis worsened, the Bank of England told banks to cancel share buybacks and dividends. That led to uproar for StanChart’s main rival, HSBC Holdings, where Hong Kong-based retail shareholders make up more than a third of the investor base and many were dependent on dividend income.

Mr Vinals said the reaction to the dividend halt among Standard Chartered’s investors had been more muted.

“Our shareholder base is very much institutional,” he said. “We have a very small fraction of retail shareholding, and that retail shareholding base is not concentrated in Hong Kong.”","In Britain, where the bank is based but has no branch network, more than 98 per cent of staff are working from home, Mr Vinals said.

24,hsbc,19-04-2020,"Abu Dhabi’s $7 billion (Dh25.7bn) multi-tranche international bond offering received strong investor interest despite concerns about the global economy.

“The success of the issuance, particularly amidst the global uncertainties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the oil price decline, is testament to the continued confidence placed in our aptitude to generate sustainable economic growth,” Jassim Al Zaabi, chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Finance, said in a statement on Sunday.

“Our robust credit fundamentals and strong credit ratings with stable outlooks have enabled us to attract remarkable demand from a diverse pool of investors from the international debt capital markets.”

The bond issuance was oversubscribed more than six times, pushing the order book to $45bn, the highest oversubscription achieved by Abu Dhabi. International investors accounted for 90 per cent of the final orderbook, with the remaining 10 per cent from the Mena region.

Subscription requests from more than 100 new investor accounts reflected confidence in the emirate’s ""solid credit fundamentals”, the statement said.

On April 8, the emirate priced its bond offering, which comprised a $2bn five-year tranche, a $2bn 10-year tranche and a $3bn 30-year tranche. The bond deal is part of Abu Dhabi’s medium-term strategy to help it diversify its sources of funding and optimise its capital structure.

The debt profile of Abu Dhabi – rated Aa2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA/A-1+ by S&P – continues to be prudent, underscored by low direct government debt. The emirate has fiscal flexibility and the capacity to add more debt, Mr Al Zaabi said.

“On that basis, we seized the opportunity to capitalise on the current available market window. Our debt management strategy is a vital component of Abu Dhabi’s economic development and supports the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030,” he said.

Sovereigns and quasi-government companies in the region are looking to raise debt to take advantage of the low interest rate environment, as they shore up finances amid lower oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic that has infected more than 2.3 million people globally. Central banks have cut rates to encourage lending as the global economy slips into the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Despite a challenging global economic backdrop, Abu Dhabi remains the highest priced sovereign from the region, according to the Department of Finance.

BofA Securities, Citi, First Abu Dhabi Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan and Standard Chartered Bank were the joint lead-managers and bookrunners on the deal.

Abu Dhabi, which accounts for about six per cent of the world’s proven oil reserves, last tapped the debt markets in September 2019, when it raised $10bn through a multi-tranche issuance. The deal was more than two-and-a-half times oversubscribed, peaking at $25bn, it said at the time.","Abu Dhabi’s $7 billion (Dh25.7bn) multi-tranche international bond offering received strong investor interest despite concerns about the global economy.

25,hsbc,17-04-2020,"Coronavirus pushed China’s economy into its first contraction in decades in the first quarter, as weak consumer spending and production point to a long, hard recovery.

The world’s second-largest economy shrank 6.8 per cent from a year ago in the three months ending in March after factories, shops and travel were closed to contain the infection, official data showed Friday.

That is the worst performance since at least 1992 when official releases of quarterly GDP started and misses the median forecast of a 6 per cent drop. China’s economy hasn’t contracted on a full-year basis since the end of the Mao era in the 1970s.

Retail sales slid 15.8 per cent in March as consumers remained wary, while investment decreased 16.1 per cent in the first three months of the year. A brighter sign was the smaller-than-expected contraction in March industrial production of 1.1 per cent as factories returned to work amid easing lockdowns.

Both retailing and factory output showed improvement from their lowest points in the first two months, suggesting a stabilisation in economic activity.

“We expect this recovery to continue,” said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics Hong Kong. “However, the upturn will be slowed down by lingering consumption weakness and sliding foreign demand.”

China’s markets held on to gains after the release as investors had already anticipated the weak data. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.9 per cent at 12:30pm (8:30am UAE time), while the Hang Seng index climbed 2.3 per cent in Hong Kong.

The economy was forced into a paralysis in late January as the epidemic that first started in Wuhan spread across the country. The economy remained shuttered for much of February with factories and shops closed and workers stranded at home.

To cushion the economic blow, China has unveiled a range of support measures and has increased fiscal and monetary support – although not on the scale of other nations.

While exports fell less than expected in March as production capacity was gradually restored, economists warn headwinds lie ahead as the rest of the world shuts down and external demand diminishes.

“Most major economies are still in the lockdown stage,” Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley Asia, said on Bloomberg TV. “As a result, growth in the second quarter will be shallow, just marginally above zero.”

On the positive side, the surveyed jobless rate actually declined in March, to 5.9 per cent from February’s record 6.2 per cent. That suggests China is so far avoiding the kind of job destruction seen in the US, where more than 5 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total in the month since the coronavirus pandemic throttled the US economy to 22 million people.

Much depends now on whether consumers regain a willingness to spend amid nervousness that the virus can stage a comeback as controls are relaxed.

26,hsbc,16-04-2020,"HSBC and a clutch of other banks have a combined exposure of at least $3 billion (Dh11bn) to Singapore’s Hin Leong Trading, and are in talks with the privately-held oil trader over shoring up its finances, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

A group of about 10 lenders including HSBC, Singapore’s three largest banks, Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank held a virtual meeting with the oil trader and its advisers on Tuesday, the people said, asking not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly. HSBC has the biggest exposure to Hin Leong at about $600 million, they added.

Singapore’s closely-knit oil trading community is gripped by speculation over the predicament of one of its biggest players and the potentially far-reaching impact its difficulties could have on the market and trading partners. Before crude’s spectacular crash due to the coronavirus crisis, it would have been almost unfathomable that a company of Hin Leong’s status could be in such a position.

Bloomberg reported last week that some banks wouldn’t issue new letters of credit to the trader because of concern over its ability to repay the short-term debt. Nobody responded to calls or emails to the company seeking comment.

DBS Group Holdings, Singapore’s largest lender, has an exposure of about $300m to Hin Leong, while its local competitors Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp and United Overseas Bank are owed at least $100m each.

Representatives for HSBC, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank and the three Singapore lenders declined to comment.

Among the measures discussed at the Tuesday meeting were debt reduction, extending loan maturities and some form of moratorium on repayments, according to one of the people.

The banks are planning to come back early next week on possible solutions, and will likely appoint an adviser to help them in their negotiations, another person said.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore, the nation’s financial regulator and central bank, last week eased capital requirements to give banks more leeway to bolster lending during the coronavirus-fuelled slowdown.

Founded by legendary self-made Chinese tycoon Lim Oon Kuin, Hin Leong could be the latest casualty of the collapse in oil prices and a heightened caution among lenders to finance commodity trades.

The company was established in 1963 and has grown into one of Asia’s largest suppliers of ship fuel, or bunkers. OK Lim, as the founder is known, built the company from a one-man, one-truck oil dealer to a regional powerhouse with assets including 130 vessels and businesses across oil trading, terminal and storage, bunker supply and lubricants manufacturing, according to its website.

The company’s bunkering arm, Ocean Bunkering Services, was ranked the third-largest shipping fuel supplier in Singapore last year, according to the city-state’s Maritime and Port Authority. Singapore is the world’s biggest shipping fuel bunkering hub.

Letters of credit are a critical financial lifeline for commodity traders, used as a way of financing short-term trade. A bank issues the letters on behalf of the buyer as a guarantee of payment to the seller. Once the goods have exchanged hands, the buyer repays the lender.","HSBC has the biggest exposure to Hin Leong at about $600 million, they added.

27,hsbc,15-04-2020,"German sports retailer Adidas on Tuesday said it received approval for a syndicated €3 billion (Dh12bn) government-backed loan to mitigate the financial impact on its business from the spread of the coronavirus.

The retail sector has been hit by measures designed to limit social movement and by the postponement or cancellation of large sports events, including the Olympic games.

""Today, the company received the approval of the German government for the participation of KfW, Germany's state-owned development bank, in a syndicated revolving loan facility amounting to €3bn,"" Adidas said.

The loan, which will be priced in line with market conditions, comprises a loan commitment of €2.4bn from KfW and €600m in loan commitments from a consortium including UniCredit, Bank of America, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Mizuho Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.

One of the conditions of the syndicated loan is that the company suspends dividend payments for the duration of the loan, Adidas said, adding that company's Executive Board stopped the repurchasing of Adidas shares and decided to forgo its short- and long-term bonus for the year 2020.

Adidas also said it was still unable to provide an outlook for the full year 2020 and that publication of first quarter results would be on April 27, 2020.","German sports retailer Adidas on Tuesday said it received approval for a syndicated €3 billion (Dh12bn) government-backed loan to mitigate the financial impact on its business from the spread of the coronavirus.

28,hsbc,15-04-2020,"TransferWise, a global low-cost digital money transfer service, is now operating in the UAE, six months after receiving its license from Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the company said on Tuesday.

“Now the big day has come and we’re actually launching,” Kristo Kaarmann, chief executive and co-founder of TransferWise told The National. “The UAE is one of the most important remittance markets in the world, and we’re delighted to be bringing the first fully online money transfers to the country”.

A total of Dh169.2 billion was sent from the UAE in 2018 out of total global remittances of $689bn (Dh2.5 trillion), according to Central Bank and World Bank figures, respectively. The Emirates and Saudi Arabia were the second and third top remittance countries after the US in 2017.

TransferWise, which was founded in the UK in 2011, has 14 global offices, 7 million customers worldwide and processes $5bn in customer payments every month. The platform enables people to send money online at the mid-market exchange rate – the midpoint between demand and supply for a currency – and charges an upfront, transparent fee.

The company’s goal is to make sending money abroad more convenient, cheaper and faster. After TransferWise received its ADGM license in October, 15,000 customers signed up to be notified about the availability of currency routes from the UAE.

“That just gives you a hint of the demand,” Mr Kaarmann said. In a beta trial with 3,000 customers, popular transfer destinations included the UK, the eurozone, the US, followed by Asian countries.

“People can now send money to over 80 countries without leaving their homes, and all at the real, mid-market exchange rate,” he said.

The company offers over 1,600 currency routes and 49 currencies. Customers in the UAE with a bank account can verify their identification and register for TransferWise online.

Globally, TransferWise claims to save users $1bn a year compared to making the same transaction with a bank. In the Emirates, the company cites research carried out by UAE-based Viva Consulting that found the cost of sending money abroad was “up to two times cheaper” with TransferWise compared to six banks and brokers.

The study compared the cost of sending remittances from the UAE between March 1 and 5 with Al Ansari Exchange, Al Fardan Exchange, Western Union, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), HSBC and Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB). The data points were for transfers from dirhams to US dollars, euros and British pounds, including upfront fees and exchange rate markups.

Al Ansari, Western Union and HSBC declined to comment. ADCB and DIB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Osama Al Rahma, chief executive of Al Fardan, said the claim does not reflect “the facts and figures on the ground”. The “UAE is considered one of the cheapest in charges worldwide,” Mr Al Rahma said.

The global average cost to send $200 in the first quarter of this year was 6.79 per cent, according to the World Bank’s March 2020 Remittance Prices Worldwide report.

The cost of sending money from the UAE varies by destination and method. The World Bank publishes cost comparisons on its website, covering 12 corridors from the UAE, including top receivers India, Pakistan and the Philippines.

For example, from the UAE to India, the average cost to send Dh735 ($200) was 3.04 per cent as of February. The cheapest was Emirates NBD Direct Remit, which is only available to bank customers, but has no fee and an exchange rate margin of 0.82 per cent. Traditional money exchange operators, including Western Union, Al Ansari and Al Fardan, charged between Dh20 and Dh24, which is around 3 per cent. Noor Bank was the most expensive, charging over 9 per cent.

Sending Dh735 to India through TransferWise on Tuesday would have cost Dh12.63 in fees, which is 1.71 per cent.

TransferWise said the speed of transfers is another factor that sets it apart. “Globally we’re able to deliver 25 per cent of our payments in 20 seconds,” Mr Kaarmann said.

Abu Dhabi will serve as the company’s hub for expansion elsewhere in the Middle East, although Mr Kaarmann said it is “too soon for us to comment” on where they will go next.

Tim Harley, head of Middle East expansion for TransferWise, said the firm looks at the size of the opportunity, product differentiation and the maturity of the regulatory landscape. He pointed to the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, which in February released additional licensing guidelines for digital-only banks in the kingdom.

“These are great signs to us and that shows us that regulators are looking to each other in the region, as well as to other regions,” Mr Harley said.

Mr Kaarmann said TransferWise is “excited to be working with [ADGM] as a local partner”, bringing “innovation on the ground to the UAE”. In July last year, ADGM’s FSRA published regulatory frameworks for the establishment of digital banks and robo-advisers.

“We are pleased to welcome TransferWise to our portfolio of financial services entities,” said Steve Barnett, executive director of business development at ADGM, in a statement. “ADGM is committed to leveraging Abu Dhabi’s robust business environment to attract the world’s foremost enterprises, in an effort to facilitate further growth and development in the UAE and across the region.”

Tim Harley, head of Middle East expansion at TransferWise, said there are positive signs that the region's regulatory environment is maturing. Victor Besa / The National

On a global level, TransferWise expanded to Malaysia at the end of last year and partnered with China's Alipay last month. In total it has raised $689 million in primary and secondary funding from investors, including private equity firm Index Ventures, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson.

The company, which was valued at $3.5bn last year after BlackRock and other investment funds acquired a $292m stake in it, stopped fundraising as it became profitable, with £179m (Dh828m) in revenue and £10.3m in net profits in the fiscal year ending March 2019.

“We’re now raising every month a ton of money from our customers in the transparent fees that we charge, so that we can launch in new countries, we can improve the service, we can get faster … basically invest in a better product,” Mr Kaarmann said.

As for the prospect of going public, he said: “That possibility is there. We haven’t moved on that and don’t have immediate plans to move on that.”

“We always try to think of ‘does it matter for our customers?’ It doesn’t really,” Mr Kaarmann said. “I think our customers don’t really care if our shares are publicly traded or privately traded.”

TransferWise conducts secondary sales to bring on new shareholders and provide liquidity for earlier stage shareholders.

For now, a major focus is satisfying demand in the UAE before moving on the next plans. “We’re just getting going here, so we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves too much,” Mr Kaarmann said.","Customers in the UAE with a bank account can verify their identification and register for TransferWise online.

29,hsbc,13-04-2020,"HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, will spend $1.2 million (Dh4.4m) from a $25m global fund on charity projects in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey region to help individuals and families affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

The lender will “immediately begin making contributions to a range of projects in Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the UAE to help an estimated 80,000 underprivileged individuals and families impacted by Covid-19”.

The funding will also help hospital workers fighting against the spread of the pandemic, HSBC said in a statement on Monday.

“Our efforts in Menat as part of the group’s $25m Covid-19 charitable fund will be vitally important to our local communities,” said Sabrin Rahman, HSBC's head of sustainability in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey.

“We have acted quickly to the urgent call for support by putting our resources to work where they have the biggest impact and donating to specific projects so that we are able to ensure accountability and track the real impact our funding has had on people's lives.”

Coronavirus, one of the biggest challenges to the global economy since the 2008 financial crisis, has disrupted trade, the travel industry and rattled investors.

Governments worldwide have launched stimulus packages worth more than $8 trillion to support their economies as unemployment surges due to lockdowns and restrictions on movement.

Companies and banks, including HSBC, have slashed their dividend pay outs and chief executives’ salaries to preserve capital to cope with the economic fallout from the pandemic.

“We carefully selected local charity partners that have track records of being able to identify and help vulnerable communities by getting them food, medicine and education resources,” Mrs Rahman added.

In the UAE, the bank has allocated $505,000, which is expected to benefit around 13,720 people.

30,hsbc,13-04-2020,"Oman's Taageer Finance and Sohar International Bank disclosed they have exposures to embattled UAE healthcare company NMC Health.

Taageer, which provides car finance and funding for industrial equipment, said in a statement on Monday to the Muscat Securities Market that it had a 1.23 million rial (Dh11.72m) exposure to NMC.

The Oman Investment Fund holds a 33.6 per cent stake in Taageer Finance and is the largest shareholder.

Sohar International Bank said its exposure stood at 3.45m rials.

“The bank is considering all options and measures available to it, including enforcement of legal rights, to ensure realisation of the outstanding amount,” the lender said in a statement to the Muscat bourse on Monday.

Sohar said it “rejected multiple requests from the company for additional credit facilities worth 43m rials"", including a request to roll over the maturing loan, which was paid off in December 2019.

The loan amount to NMC represents 0.1 per cent of Sohar Bank's total assets.

""The prudent and diligent measures taken by the bank not only significantly reduced the exposure but also avoided a substantial increase of exposure to this company,” Sohar said.

NMC was placed in administration by a UK court on the application of one of its biggest lenders, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, last week.

The joint administrators from turnaround advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal will take immediate control of NMC Health and will work on behalf of all stakeholders, ADCB said on Thursday.

Taageer's disclosure comes after HSBC Bank Oman revealed on Sunday that NMC owes it $16m (Dh58.76m), about 0.2 per cent of its total assets.

Bank Nizwa, also listed on Muscat Securities Market, said last week that it had a 5m rial exposure to the healthcare company through a subsidiary, Elegant Medical Centre.

Apart from ADCB, number of UAE banks also extended financing to NMC and they include Emirates NBD, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and Dubai Islamic Bank .

ADCB has an exposure of $981m to NMC. Its exposure increases to $1.16 billion when Finablr, another company owned by NMC Health's founder B R Shetty, is factored in. Finablr is not in administration.

Overall, UAE banks have a combined exposure of at least Dh8bn to NMC.

NMC made a series of damaging disclosures in the past few months after a report by activist investor Muddy Waters in December alleged that it had inflated cash balances, overpaid for assets and understated its debt.

Last month, the company revealed its debt stood at $6.6bn, substantially higher than the $2.1bn declared in its last filed accounts. A review committee also discovered evidence of “suspected fraudulent behaviour”.

After the disclosures, two joint non-executive chairmen, including Mr Shetty, as well as the executive vice-chairman, chief executive, chief financial officer and a member of the treasury department left the company.

NMC appointed Ithmar Capital’s managing partner, Faisal Belhoul, as executive chairman on March 26 after the Dubai private equity firm took a 9 per cent stake in the healthcare company.

In February, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority launched an investigation into NMC's activities after the company's shares were suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange.","Oman's Taageer Finance and Sohar International Bank disclosed they have exposures to embattled UAE healthcare company NMC Health.

31,hsbc,12-04-2020,"The UAE rolled out new measures to support exporters affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Etihad Credit Insurance (ECI), a federal entity, will assist exporters and businesses facing payment and supply chain disruptions with export credit insurance and additional funding, the agency said on Sunday.

“For exporters and businesses that are concerned about getting paid, ECI offers an export credit insurance solution that can help them recover the cost of fulfilling an order that is terminated by events outside their control, such as the adverse impacts of Covid-19,” said Massimo Falcioni, its chief executive.

The coronavirus pandemic, the biggest challenge to the global economy since the 2008 financial crisis, has disrupted trade, the travel industry and rattled investors. About $17 trillion (Dh62.4tn) has been wiped from stock markets worldwide. Global equity markets are now valued at $72.16tn, from a high of $89tn earlier this year, according to Bloomberg data.

The UAE has taken a number of measures to cushion the impact on local businesses, including stimulus measures to the tune of Dh256 billion from the central bank.

Earlier today, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy also reduced fees for 94 of its services, resulting in Dh113 million worth of savings for businesses in 2020. Fees have been reduced on a range of services linked to innovation, business, investment, production, trade as well as import and export activities.

“Reducing fees for services provided by the Ministry of Economy to individuals and companies will reduce the cost of establishing and conducting business in the country and will reduce the burden on commercial and investment institutions, which is to support the main and affected sectors stimulating the economic environment and ensuring the sustainability of the pioneering structure of the national economy and business continuity,” said Sultan Al Mansouri, Minister of Economy.

Among the most prominent fees being cut are for commercial registration, trademark and intellectual property services, as well as fees linked to commercial agencies and auditors.

ECI is also offering financial support to domestic companies through bank loans, it said.

“ECI has built a large ecosystem of strategic partners including local and international banks, including FAB, ADCB, Emirates NBD, RAK Bank, National Bank of Fujairah, HSBC, Standard Chartered and Natixis, which might offer loans at a concessional rate, guaranteed by ECI to secure the funding of the supply chain,” added Mr Falcioni.

The organisation is also offering exporters advice on finding alternative suppliers if supply chains are disrupted due to coronavirus restrictions.

“The UAE’s federal export company has a global network of more than 360 million businesses worldwide and can assist in advising on available options and connect UAE exporters to alternative suppliers to sustain their trade operations in the international markets,” it said.","The UAE rolled out new measures to support exporters affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

The joint administrators from turnaround advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal will take immediate control of NMC Health and will work on behalf of all stakeholders, according to a statement from ADCB on Thursday.

“Their priority is to ensure stability and the continuation of uninterrupted healthcare services at the group’s medical facilities,” ADCB said.

“The joint administrators are also tasked with implementing robust governance, conducting a full, transparent investigation into suspected previous irregular financial activity and taking adequate steps to initiate the recovery of any missing assets and funds.”

ADCB earlier declared that it has an exposure of $981m to NMC. ADCB's exposure increases to Dh$1.16bn when factoring in Finablr, another company owned by NMC Health's founder BR Shetty, which is not in administration. Overall, UAE banks have a combined exposure of at least Dh8bn to NMC.

Dubai’s biggest lender, Emirates NBD, and a number of other banks including Dubai Islamic Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, Commercial Bank International, National Bank of Fujairah and RAK Bank, among others, extended financing to NMC.

Dubai Islamic Bank said it is owed $425m by NMC, and that Noor Bank, which it acquired in January, is owed $116m. Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank is owed $291.4m, and has a $31m investment in an NMC Health sukuk.

Dubai’s biggest lender, Emirates NBD, is owed Dh747.3m – most of which is due to Emirates Islamic Bank, the bank said last week.

NMC was founded by Mr Shetty in Abu Dhabi in 1975, and now employs more than 2,000 doctors and about 20,000 other staff. It operates 2,200 hospital beds as well as clinics and pharmacies in 19 countries.

33,hsbc,06-04-2020,"Dubai’s Tabreed bought a majority stake in Emaar Properties’ Downtown Dubai district cooling business for Dh2.48 billion on Monday and said it is looking at new opportunities in its core markets to boost growth.

“Our appetite remains for new transactions. As long as it makes commercial sense and provides value the shareholders expect from us, we will definitely be pursuing including acquisitions as well as greenfield projects,” chief executive Bader Al Lamki told The National in an interview.

Tabreed, in which France's Engie and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Company hold stakes, currently operates in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.

It provides district cooling to developments such as the Dubai Metro and Ferrari World in the UAE; Bahrain’s financial centre and the Jabal Omar Development in Saudi Arabia.

“Geographies of priority are Gulf states, North Africa and [the] Indian sub-continent and if opportunities arise beyond these markets, we will be mindful and we will be open and look at them on a case-by-case basis,” he said .

The company is well placed to ride out the current economic downturn in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and is looking at long-term growth, Mr Al Lamki said.

“Our business is quite stable ... we continued to manage our operations and adjusted to the current situation. The business is not interrupted,"" he said.

""We are taking whatever actions are required in our liquidity and we are very much in a position to navigate this period with minimum impact.”

The transaction with Emaar Properties will result in Tabreed controlling 80 per cent of the district cooling scheme serving Downtown Dubai, one of the biggest in the world, while Emaar will retain the remaining stake as part of a long- term partnership with Tabreed, the companies said in a joint statement to the Dubai Financial Market, where their shares trade.

The deal is being financed through a corporate loan secured from HSBC and other banks.

“As new opportunities come our way, we will be assessing our financing solutions; some can be through equity, some can be a mix of equity and debt and others could be fully financed. We have flexibility and look at case by case,” Mr Al Lamki said .

Downtown Dubai is the flagship project of Emaar Properties, the biggest-listed developer in the UAE. The master development is home to the iconic Burj Khalifa – the world’s tallest building, the Dubai Mall and other residential, commercial and hospitality developments.

The long-term concession will exclusively provide up to 235,000 refrigeration tons of cooling to the development.

The utility scheme currently provides 150,000 RT of contracted capacity through a network that distributes chilled water produced through three interconnected district cooling plants. A fourth plant is currently under construction.

After the transaction, Tabreed’s total capacity increases by 12.6 per cent to 1,338,602 RT from 83 plants.

“This is … a truly transformational transaction for the company, accelerating our growth trajectory and consolidating our position in Dubai,” Khaled Al Qubaisi, chairman of Tabreed, said.

“This acquisition in the world’s largest district cooling market is a further testament to our financial strength and leading market position.”

After the deal was announced, Moody's Investors Service affirmed the Baa3 long-term issuer rating of Tabreed and also its Baa3 instrument rating on the company's senior unsecured sukuk certificates.

""The acquisition materially improves Tabreed's position in Dubai, the world's largest district cooling market and contributes to improve Tabreed's operating diversity,"" the ratings agency said.

""With it, Tabreed becomes the second-largest district cooling player in Dubai, with an estimated 18 per cent market share.""

Tabreed is well placed to take advantage of growth opportunities and expects its enhanced presence within Dubai will help it achieve its long-term objectives, Mr Al Qubaisi said.

The deal is Tabreed’s second acquisition this year. In January, the company bought cooling plants in Masdar City and said it will explore the development of large-scale cooling plants in Sharjah through a venture with environmental management company Bee'ah.

Tabreed is also consolidating a number of service offerings to set up a new entity, Tabreed Energy Services, offering consultancy services, as well as operation and maintenance services for cooling plants.","Dubai’s Tabreed bought a majority stake in Emaar Properties’ Downtown Dubai district cooling business for Dh2.48 billion on Monday and said it is looking at new opportunities in its core markets to boost growth.

34,hsbc,05-04-2020,"As stock market volatility looks set to continue for some time, investors can be forgiven for wanting to flee the carnage and hide their money in the safest possible haven.

In chaotic times like these, traditional stores of value such as bonds, gold and cash often come into their own, by shielding investors from the worst of the meltdown.

However, both gold and bonds have performed erratically in recent weeks, while returns on cash are plunging even lower, amid a flurry of global interest rate cuts.

Before the coronavirus crisis struck, some cryptocurrency fans argued that Bitcoin also offers protection, but it has subsequently fallen even faster than shares.

So which of these safe havens, if any, should you be racing to right now?

Government bonds

US government bonds, or Treasuries, are one of the lowest-risk investments in the world.

They are issued by the US Department of the Treasury to finance government spending, and it pledges to raise money by any means legally available to repay them. No wonder investors rush to buy them in a crisis.

After wild swings in March, US Treasuries have now justified their safe haven status again. Michael Bolliger, UBS Global Wealth Management

Michael Bolliger, analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, says US Treasuries also benefit from being issued in the world's reserve currency.

Despite these advantages, bonds were incredibly volatile in March. While prices initially went up as stock markets fell, they then fell as panicky traders dumped long-term bonds because they anticipated a surge in the supply of newly issued debt, which would drive down prices.

Bond traders later calmed down after the Senate approved a massive $2 trillion (Dh7.34tn) economic relief package. “After wild swings in March, US Treasuries have now justified their safe haven status again,” Mr Bolliger says.

When bonds are in demand, prices rise, but yields fall. On Friday, the yield on a 10-year US Treasury fell to just 0.59 per cent. If you invest in a 30-year Treasury, you get only slightly more at 1.23 per cent.

US Treasuries are safe, but you pay a high price for that kind of security these days.

To get exposure, USD Treasury Bond UCITS ETF (VDTY), which invests 100 per cent in US Treasuries, currently yields 2.06 per cent. It boasts an impressive year-to-date return of 8.91 per cent, or 14.69 per cent over 12 months, according to Bloomberg.

Gold

Gold is the oldest store of value but its price also fell in March, as fund managers took profits and used the money to cover losses elsewhere, meet customer redemptions or buy shares at reduced prices.

The gold price is nonetheless up a punchy 26.74 per cent over the last year, according to Goldprice.org. Carsten Menke, head of next generation research at Julius Baer, says its safe haven status holds good. “As the global recession unfolds, we still see more upside for gold,” he adds.

Gold is still some way off its all-time high price of $1,895 per ounce, which it hit during the eurozone crisis in September 2011.

At the time of writing, it trades at $1,618, and Mr Menke says it will only top its previous record if the crisis “moves out of hand and the expected short and sharp recession turns into a longer-lasting depression”.

Professor Stephen Thomas, associate dean, MBA Programmes at Cass Business School in Dubai and London, says gold has enjoyed a fantastic 12 months, along with US bonds, proving the importance of having a diversified portfolio. “The gold price certainly isn't going to collapse in the current environment, when shares are impossible to value.”

The danger comes when markets recover, as the gold price could slip back, but there seems little danger of that right now.

Perhaps the easiest way to invest in gold is through an exchange traded fund. WisdomTree Physical Gold (PHAU) is up 6.07 per cent so far in 2020 and 24.74 per cent over 12 months, according to Bloomberg, while iShares Physical Gold (SGLN) is up 14.35 per cent and 34.20 per cent over the same period.

Cash

Cash has been out of favour since interest rates were slashed to near zero during the global financial crisis of 2008.

Last month, the US Federal Reserve cut its already-low benchmark interest rate to zero in repsonse to the current crisis, but Mr Thomas says that is the least of people's worries right now. “Cash has been underappreciated for too long. In today's low inflation world, it might be a hidden gem in your portfolio,” he adds.

Cash is safe but just remember that it will not completely protect your capital, as inflation may erode its value in real terms.

Mr Bolliger at UBS says in the longer run, you need your money to work harder than it will sitting in cash. “Money markets yield little to nothing, and even with inflation rates rather low, cash holdings offer negative real expected returns.”

However, amid today’s extreme volatility, many investors will still appreciate the comfort that cash offers.

To get exposure, a search on comparison site Souqalmal.com shows HSBC eSaver pays up to 1.5 per cent in interest, Emirates Smart Saver Account pays 1.5 per cent, RAKBank Fast Saver pays 1.75 per cent and ADCB Active Saver Account up to 2 per cent. The interest rate you receive depends on factors such as how much you save and in which currency.

Bitcoin

Before Covid-19, fans of cryptocurrencies started to circulate the theory that Bitcoin was now a safe bolthole in a crisis. The last month has proved them wrong.

On February 12, Bitcoin traded at $10,350. Exactly one month later, as coronavirus swept the West, its price had slumped to $4,857 as panicky investors fled risky assets in a rush to raise cash ahead of an expected liquidity crunch. It has recovered slightly to $6,720, but as Vijay Valecha, chief investment officer at Century Financial, notes: “Bitcoin has actually been the biggest loser in this crash, falling 70 per cent as traders and investors shifted into cash.”

The cryptocurrency is a speculative and highly volatile investment, making it a poor safe haven, Mr Valecha says. “Bitcoin may be more erratic than ever amid the current volatility.”

Mr Bolliger says: “We do not consider Bitcoin as an investment vehicle, and would recommend investors not to see cryptocurrencies as a safe haven asset.”

Stay diversified

As bonds and gold have both demonstrated, even safer asset classes can fall, but Mr Valecha says their recent minor correction may be healthy because both were in danger of becoming too expensive. They now look more attractive at today's slightly lower price.

Maurice Gravier, chief investment officer at Emirates NBD, says whatever happens in the stock market, one thing never changes: “The absolute golden rule in investment is diversification.”

Every investor should build a balanced portfolio that includes shares, bonds, gold, property and cash. So if one asset plunges, the others may compensate by holding firm or rising.

The balance you hold will reflect personal factors such as your age, and attitude to risk.

Mr Gravier says even safe havens can crumble if investors rush into cash to reduce or cover their losses. “This extreme correlation is generally temporary, so if anything it can be an opportunity,” he says.

Along with diversification, time is your best defence. Whether buying risky assets like shares, or safer options such as bonds and gold, you should aim to hold for the long term. ""Avoid being a forced seller at the worst possible time, and having to take your losses,"" says Mr Gravier.

Panic episodes like this one are a good opportunity to buy assets you are underexposed to, he says.

Currently, he is neutral on gold, relatively overweight in cash and underweight in bonds. “We are always ready to adjust,” Mr Gravier adds.","So which of these safe havens, if any, should you be racing to right now?

35,first abu dhabi bank,10-05-2020,"It feels like a lifetime ago, but it has been just over 100 days since a family on holiday from China became the first Covid-19 cases reported in the UAE.

The group from the city of Wuhan – the centre of what was then not a full-blown pandemic – took their grandmother to a clinic with flu-like symptoms on January 23.

All four family members, including the parents and a girl, 9, were tested and found to have Covid-19. They had arrived in Dubai on an Emirates flight a week earlier.

At the time, the coronavirus was ravaging parts of China, with more people 80 dead and nearly 3,000 confirmed cases. Only a day before the news broke, Minister of Health Abdul Rahman Al Owais had declared the UAE to be free of the disease.

Liu Yujia, 73, the first woman to have coronavirus in the UAE recovers from the disease. Wam

However, the authorities knew it was only a matter of time before the contagion arrived and had acted accordingly.

The Ministry of Health and Prevention had put airports and entry points to the country on standby to monitor for possible cases at least a week earlier. By January 25, Etihad was screening passengers and crew arriving from China, with dedicated gates at Abu Dhabi airport and thermal cameras to detect symptoms.

At the same time, hospitals and health clinics were drawing up plans and running emergency drills for when – as seemed increasingly certain – not if, Covid-19 came to the UAE.

That fateful last week in January also gave the world and the UAE the first taste of what might be in store for their economies, as oil prices began what would turn out to be a long slide downward as demand began to fall.

Within days of the first UAE cases, concerns began to spread, with a huge surge in demand for face masks such that one online retailer was offering them for Dh699 each.

On February 1, another case was declared, another traveller from China, while a fall in demand led Emirates to switch to smaller planes on some of its routes to the country.

By February 22, an Iranian couple brought the number of UAE cases to 13, as the ending of the Venice Carnival gave a taste of what was soon to come, with Dubai private schools told to cancel all trips a week later and nurseries closed.

By the end of the month, the final stage of the UAE Tour had to be cancelled as two hotels on Yas Island were placed on lockdown after two Italian cyclists tested positive for coronavirus.

It was March when the storm truly broke, beginning with widespread cancellations and postponements and the closure of all schools for at least a month on March 3. The next day, orders were given for all football in the UAE to be played in empty stadiums, with the UAE’s World Cup qualifiers postponed on March 9.

That week, Art Dubai and Taste of Dubai were postponed, Global Village was closed and local cruise operations were suspended. By March 10, the number of UAE cases had risen to 74. A day later, shisha smoking was banned in “tourist establishments”.

On March 14, the UAE Central Bank rolled out a Dh100 billion stimulus package, ahead of much of the world, as oil prices continued their steep plunge. Across the country, gyms, theme parks and cinemas were closed.

The world was now pulling down the shutters. In mid-March, visas-on-arrival were cancelled for more than 70 countries, followed by the temporary suspension of entry for GCC citizens on March 21.

A day earlier came the sad news of the first two coronavirus-related deaths in the country, included a 78-year-old Arab national who had recently arrived from Europe.

March 23 will long be remembered. Malls and markets were ordered to close within 48 hours, except for those selling food and medicines. All flights were suspended and everyone told to stay at home unless “absolutely necessary”. The number of Covid-19 cases in the UAE topped 300, and banks were told only to use new notes in ATMs. A night curfew was introduced for deep cleaning of streets at the weekend of March 26.

The first rescue flights to bring home hundreds of Emiratis stranded overseas began in early April, while Emirates and Etihad announced the start of limited one-way repatriation flights for residents who wished to return home. Dubai closed its Metro for the first time since September 9, 2009.

By April 5, there had been 1,799 cases of Covid-19 in the UAE and 10 deaths. Across the country families settled to a new routine of working and studying from home, while Christians celebrated Easter on April 12 with remote services streamed from empty churches. From April 13, passengers leaving the country had a sticker placed on their passport reading “We’ll meet soon.”

By the middle of the month, the UAE had conducted nearly 650,000 Covid-19 tests, the third highest in the world per capita, diagnosing more than 4,000 cases but with 680 recoveries. These were carried out at hospitals, specialist centres and at least 14 drive-through testing facilities across the country.

A new hospital dedicated to Covid-19 patients opened at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City on April 23. It had been built in just 48 hours. Field hospitals were also built across the country to increase capacity.

By the end of April, there were the first signs of a return to a more normal life. Contactless card readers were introduced in Abu Dhabi taxis and several Dubai Metro stations opened on April 29. Hotels began to reopen, with facilities restricted to guests, while shopping malls were able to welcome back customers.

Just 100 days after the first known case, the UAE has recorded more than 16,000 infections, and sadly, as of May 7, 165 deaths.","It feels like a lifetime ago, but it has been just over 100 days since a family on holiday from China became the first Covid-19 cases reported in the UAE.

36,first abu dhabi bank,10-05-2020,"Abu Dhabi is introducing an initiative to boost exports from the emirate to 60 target markets worldwide in an effort to further expand its foreign trade.

The new digital platform, Abu Dhabi Export Gateway, will “offer an integrated approach” to exporting at least 100 local products from 10 different sectors, the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development said on Sunday.

The new project will further support local export companies. It will also expand their contribution to the emirate’s gross domestic product as efficiency, export capacity and investments improve, Mohammed Ali Al Shorafa, chairman of the department, said.

The first phase of the Abu Dhabi Export Gateway is set to be launched in August.

“The platform will cover more than 100 local products across 10 different sectors and industries and is designed to accommodate expansion as local exporters may add more products they wish to promote via the platform.”

The new platform will also provide statistics on local exports and information about the economic performance of crucial sectors in Abu Dhabi and the UAE.

Mr Al Shorafa said the 60 target markets across the world were chosen based on the emirate’s established connections, economic relations and mutual trade.

The team managing the project will frequently review the needs of local companies and demand in foreign markets during the next six months, Ghanem Al Mazrouei, the department's executive director of international economic relations, said.

“Based on the results, the platform will add other global markets and target sectors, as well as a range of smart digital services that would enhance local companies’ exporting capabilities and practices.”

The unveiling of the platform comes as the UAE launches new measures to support exporters affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, Etihad Credit Insurance, a federal entity, said it would extend export credit insurance and additional funding to exporters and businesses facing payment and supply chain disruptions.

It is offering financial support to domestic companies through bank loans.

Abu Dhabi also waived Dh246 million in penalties to support small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the commercial and industrial sectors earlier this year.

The waived fines are related to various economic infractions including licence renewal delays, engaging in additional economic activities not covered by an existing licence and the improper storage of goods in unsafe areas.","Abu Dhabi is introducing an initiative to boost exports from the emirate to 60 target markets worldwide in an effort to further expand its foreign trade.

37,first abu dhabi bank,10-05-2020,"If you are struggling professionally, then Chris Gardner has a message for you.

“Skills, talent and expertise are transferable,” he says. “The key is where you choose to transfer those things. You have to do something that you're truly passionate about.”

It is a concept that not only forms the basis of his bestselling 2010 book Start Where You Are, but remains a principle that has served him well throughout his storied life.

That motto is so good, in fact, it inspired Gardner’s first book – the hit-memoir-turned-Oscar-nominated-2006-film, The Pursuit of Happyness.

If you are not familiar with the work, published the same year as the film’s release, then here is a quick recap: a struggling stockbroker and single father raises his son while on the poverty line in San Francisco.

Through ambition and toil, he manages to eventually find secure housing and a better job that fast-tracks his career to chief executive of his own business and motivational speaker.

Even if you have already seen the film, don’t skip the book.

Like most cases, the literary version offers a more rounded affair. While the film focuses on one year of Gardner’s life, the book is more sweeping story as it recalls his troubled childhood and early ambition to become a doctor.

While the rag-to-riches journey has become a tired marketing trope of self-help literature, what elevates Gardner’s work above the pack is its sheer grittiness.

Written with Miles Davis memoirist Quincy Troupe, Gardner is unflinching in detailing his faults as he tries to find a way out of dire straits.

As it turns out, the impetus he needed came after the following insights: find acceptance in the past, focus on the challenges ahead and move forward.

A light in a cave

Where The Pursuit of Happyness traced the discovery of those valuable life lessons, Start Where You Are finds him synthesising these ideas in a book that offers a road map for those feeling lost in their careers and personal lives.

Gardner will be detailing his experiences further on Sunday, May 10, during a session streamed on the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair’s YouTube page at 10pm.

With the book written in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, Gardner’s insights will prove useful in this particular tumultuous period, in which the ongoing pandemic has already caused mass unemployment across various sectors.

That feeling of hopelessness is something he is intimately familiar with. He saw it first hand when running his brokerage firm in the US when the financial crisis struck.

“I was on the train in Washington in the middle of the day and, where it would normally be empty, this train was packed with the first wave of 50,000 people who lost their jobs at Citibank,” Gardner recalls.

“It was packed with people carrying these boxes. Inside were their degrees, their personal items, the pictures of their kids, the house plans and they were all worried because they were going home to tell their families and the bank that they no longer have a job.”

Gardner says Start Where You Are was born out of a conversation he shared with one of the laid-off passengers. Recognising him from television – the success of The Pursuit of Happyness made Gardner a celebrity, after all – the passenger sought his advice.

Gardner kept it succinct. “I was trying to get him to see that you lost your job, but you have not lost your skills, talent or expertise. I told this young man that now is time for creating opportunities where you can be at your prime. Because looking for an opportunity and a job are two different things. It's about finding that one thing that you love so much that you will wake up before the sun goes up for and do it for free,” he says.

“The best part was about a year later, I got a call from that same person who said that he and his friends got the money from their retirement plans and started a new company. And the first company that hired them was who? Citibank. Now, isn’t that cool or what?”

The anecdote demonstrates the power of well-placed encouragement.

However, if you are looking for number-crunching tips on how to make your next million dirhams, then Start Where You Are is not the book for you. Instead, the work is tailored to those who have found their well-laid career plans suddenly derailed.

Over its brisk 44 chapters (described as life lessons), Gardner offers advice on the best ways to tackle problems and make smart decisions, with anecdotes taken from personal experiences and time spent on the trading floor.

“And this is why I have been travelling so much and trying to meet as many young people that I can in all kinds of events and festivals,” he says. “I am just trying to be a light in a cave. It’s about providing that encouragement and instilling that belief that they can do what they always wanted. But it comes with knowing what you want to focus on.”

When Gardner first met Will Smith

Chances are, that shift in focus will work for you.

After all, it did wonders for Will Smith, whose portrayal of Gardner earned him the biggest acclaim of his career and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.

Gardner says he knew the film was in good hands after his first meeting with the Hollywood star in 2005.

“He invited me over to his house for dinner and I brought along the script and my notes as he requested. But more importantly I brought a picture of me and my son that was on the cover of my book,” he recalls.

“I said to him that we can talk about the script or we can talk about these two guys, what do you want to do? Well, you know what he chose. As a result, he trusted me to be more open and I trusted him as artist to cut and paste and do whatever an artist has to do to tell a story. And it all turned out great. I couldn’t be happier.”

Declining to give his full name, Fahmi looked into the rate over five years for a Dh2.5 million mortgage and found it to be expensive, costing “close to Dh180,000 in interest”.

Shortly thereafter, he came across a limited-time offer from the property developer Aldar through three lenders: a 1.99 per cent rate over five years with no application or valuation fees.

“Now with this offer, I’m only paying Dh113,000 over five years. You’re talking close to 40 per cent reduction,” says Fahmi. “It’s as cheap as getting a car loan.”

While he was leaning towards selling to free up capital amid the Covid-19 uncertainty, the “phenomenal” rate changed his mind.

I’ve been doing home finance in Dubai for 15 years now and it’s the lowest I’ve ever seen interest rates in the UAE Richard Boyd, director at Mortgage Finder

“When I looked at the mortgage rate and the monthly payments and the fact I’ve been here for 20 years paying rent, I thought ‘this is an opportune time for me to move to a house’,” he says.

As the coronavirus continues to spread worldwide and the global economy slips further into recession with millions of people losing their jobs, it may not seem like the opportune time to add the hefty financial commitment of paying for a mortgage.

However, favourable rates, fee waivers, a reduced loan-to-value ratio, bank payment holidays and the removal of the early settlement fee are all reasons to apply for a new home loan or renegotiate an existing one in the UAE.While there are factors to take into account, such as the decline of real estate prices in recent years and job security, mortgage brokers say property buyers should take advantage of exceptionally low borrowing costs.

“I’ve been doing home finance in Dubai for 15 years now and it’s the lowest I’ve ever seen interest rates in the UAE,” says Richard Boyd, director at Mortgage Finder, part of the Property Finder Group.

With the US Federal Reserve slashing its benchmark interest rates to near zero in emergency moves in March, the UAE has seen interest rates come down significantly in that period, given that the dirham is pegged to the dollar.

The Central Bank of the UAE lowered its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.5 per cent in early March and then cut its rate on one-week certificates of deposit by 75 basis points a couple of weeks later.

Banks, as a result, have become more competitive with their mortgage offers. ""The central bank interest cuts has enabled banks to offer longer lower fixed rates and people who are on variable rates will also have seen a decline in their monthly payments for the most part,” says Stuart Roe, head of mortgages at Allsopp & Allsopp real estate agency.

As part of the central bank’s Dh256 billion stimulus package, borrowers can also benefit from loan relief from their banks for up to six months, while first-time home buyers are eligible for a 5 per cent increase in the loan-to-value ratio (up to 80 per cent for expatriates and 85 per cent for UAE nationals) and a full waiver of processing fees.

Home buyers can now get a mortgage for the lowest fixed rate of 2.7 per cent for one year, say brokers. Fixed rates for three to five years range from 2.99 per cent to 3.5 per cent. That is about 25 per cent cheaper than 12 months ago, when an average three-year fixed rate mortgage was 3.99 per cent, says Mr Boyd.

Arran Summerhill, director of UAE mortgage broker Holo, says banks are also offering “headline rates” to further attract customers. These are often limited in time or to specific properties.

For example, the Aldar offer is only available for 30 days from April 20 and applies to customers who have already purchased or are looking to purchase homes in Yas Acres, The Bridges on Al Reem Island, and Mamsha and Jawaher on Al Saadiyat Island.

Homeowners in those communities were able to apply for financing through Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank. Although subject to terms and conditions and approval, the offer included a rate from 1.99 per cent, fixed for three or five years, and up to six months’ deferral on first instalments.

Lower real estate prices have also been an important factor encouraging people in the UAE to get on the property ladder. Prices have gone down between 20 to 40 per cent over the last couple of years, says Mr Summerhill.

“The stimulus package and the decrease in the rates and the lower prices has offset some of the uncertainty in the market,” he says.

Over the last two months, mortgage applications through the Holo site have grown threefold. About 60 per cent are applications to refinance. Another trend is that about 80 per cent of applicants are end users, rather than investors, Mr Summerhill adds.

Mortgage Finder has seen a 15 per cent increase in mortgage applications in the first quarter of this year, compared to the same period in 2019. While there was a slight reduction during the coronavirus lockdown period, the numbers have gone up since movement restrictions were eased, Mr Boyd says.

Refinancing accounts for much of the increase in mortgage applications, according to brokers.

“Some clients are stuck still paying anywhere from 5 to 6 per cent, so potentially there’s good savings to switch,” Mr Boyd says.

In October, the central bank removed the 3 per cent early settlement fee for mortgages introduced in 2018 and reverted to a 1 per cent or Dh10,000 cap, whichever is lower.

Combined with low interest rates and increased lending, “it’s suddenly become a lot more relevant to look at refinancing the loans that they’ve had”, says Mr Summerhill.

There are some factors to consider, however, including the decline in property values, the percentage borrowed, the outstanding amount and the fees associated with moving to another lender.

“The downsides of switching mortgage lenders are that some people may not be able to leverage their position if their outstanding amount is less than 75 per cent of the value,” says Mr Roe.

It is still worth investigating, says Mr Summerhill. A valuation costs Dh2,500 to Dh3,500, but homeowners can get a free estimate of the value of their home at homevalue.ai.

However, it is at the discretion of banks how much to lend up to the maximum ratio, whether for a new mortgage or refinancing. As businesses and others affected by Covid-19 look to release equity from properties, some banks have reacted by limiting the amount, says Mr Summerhill.

“Some banks were only going up to 20 per cent as a maximum and they wanted to see if that was being used for property renovations,” he says. Other banks put a 50 per cent cap on “cash out”, while still others have been happy to lend at the normal limits of up to 80 per cent for a first property or up to 60 per cent for a second.

In these uncertain times, job security is another key consideration. “If you’ve lost your job and you’ve actually signed to buy a property, then that can be tricky because the bank may recall the finance offer,” says Mr Boyd.

The good news is that banks are being more flexible, with some lenders willing to offer “interest-only for up to a year to help”, he says. Even clients whose salaries have been cut have had mortgage applications approved, but it depends on the bank. Home buyers in hard-hit industries such as aviation and oil & gas may also get rejected.

For Fahmi, a senior manager with a UAE company, it helped that he had a “good standing” with his bank ADCB to apply for the mortgage. With “an attractive payment scheme” from Aldar, he was able to put 10 per cent as an initial down payment on the four-bedroom villa in 2016 and pay 20 per cent before handover. He chose to pay another Dh1m in cash, paying 50 per cent of the value of the Dh5m property before taking a mortgage.

Although he was wary of the current situation, he says he felt it was the right time to move to his own home with his wife and four children.

“It is dire and difficult for many people,"" he adds, ""but I found it too good of an offer to let go.”","Stuart Roe, head of mortgages at Allsopp & Allsopp, says bank rates have at their most competitive.

40,first abu dhabi bank,06-05-2020,"A new digital collection of historical photographs offers glimpses of Palestine during the end of the Ottoman rule and the period after the First World War.

The Nasri Fuleihan Collection comprises more than 350 photographs by Nasri Fuleihan, who worked as an engineer in Palestine and helped exploring for oil in the Middle East.

His photographs, taken between 1912 and 1924, can be viewed online thanks to Akkasah, NYU Abu Dhabi’s (NYUAD) Centre for Photography, which digitises photos from the region that documents day-to-day life. The collections are shared on the centre’s website for the public to browse and for researchers to use as resources.

Born in 1891, Fuleihan was a Cypriot of Lebanese descent who studied Civil Engineering at Purdue University. After graduating in 1912, he traveled to Jordan, Palestine and Egypt and worked as an engineer in Southern Palestine at the Levant Producing Company.

During that period, Palestine was under Ottoman rule, which lasted until 1917 . In one photo, the Ottoman flag can be seen on a boat sailing along the coast of Jaffa.

Fuleihan was able to capture everyday life in Palestine, as seen in his photographs of women grinding wheat outside of a building or a priest praying in a grotto in Jerusalem. He also documented the lives of workers involved in his infrastructure projects.

He was inspired by Palestinian photographer Khalil Ra'd, whose studio he visited in Jerusalem.

The engineer also worked for the American company Standard Oil, which explored the area for oil deposits even before the war.

The company eventually ran into conflict with the British Mandate, which controlled Palestine from 1920 to 1948. Fuleihan returned to the United States in 1924, where he worked on projects such as the Holland Tunnel and George Washington Bridge. He died in New York in 1959.

Akkasah’s collection came out of a collaboration between the collection owner Gail O'Keefe Edson, Fuleihan's granddaughter, and librarian Guy Burak from the NYU Elmer Holmes Bobst Library in New York. The photographs were loaned to the library and digitised there, while the Akkasah team researched and catalogued the digital images.

Jasmine Soliman, an archivist from Akkasah who conducted research on the photographs, said: “Fuleihan's photographs tell the story of his life and career among the Middle Eastern diaspora in the United States; beginning with his time studying alongside classmates from as far afield as Japan and the Philippines and later returning to the Levant.

""There he carved out a successful career and developed a network among leaders in Palestinian society, including Selim Ayoub and Ismail Bey el Husseini, officers of the Jerusalem Chamber of Commerce and Commercial Society of Palestine Bank.”

Currently, Akkasah has 33,000 photographs in its archive, with more 10,000 images digitised and available to the public on their website.","A new digital collection of historical photographs offers glimpses of Palestine during the end of the Ottoman rule and the period after the First World War.

41,first abu dhabi bank,06-05-2020,"The General Administration of Abu Dhabi Customs rolled out an economic stimulus package to offset the impact of the coronavirus on businesses who use the emirate's ports for imports or as a transit gateway.

The new incentives include the postponement of customs duties for 90 days for importers through facilities accounts and the acceptance of institutional guarantees, instead of bank guarantees, for customs transactions.

Importers can also use pre-clearance services for clearing goods before they arrive in the country through the customs operations system. A self-clearance service allows companies to clear shipments on their own without relying on customs clearance and bond warehouses can be licenced without fees, the statement said. Companies can also issue a customs warehouse licence without the need to pay licence fees and can take items from customs warehouses without paying services fees, according to a statement.

The incentive package also includes the extension of the transit period of shipments from 3 to 5 days.

“The economic incentives package comes within the framework of Abu Dhabi government efforts to support continuously the economic system and companies, especially small and medium ones, in order to enhance the competitiveness of the emirate of Abu Dhabi and ensure business continuity for companies in all sectors,” Rashed Al Mansoori, director-general of the general administration of Abu Dhabi Customs, said.

The UAE was the first country in the Mena region to roll out fiscal and monetary support now totalling more than Dh282 billion, providing zero interest funding to encourage banks to lend in addition to a variety of other initiatives that range from discounted utility bills to waivers of government fees.

In March, the Abu Dhabi government announced a number of measures to support businesses in the emirate. The government allocated Dh5bn to subsidising water and electricity for citizens and commercial and industrial activities. It also reduced electricity connection fees for start-ups until the end of this year and exempted all commercial and industrial activities from Tawtheeq fees in 2020.

The emirate also allocated Dh3bn for an SME credit guarantee scheme, dedicated Dh1bn to establish a market maker fund to stabilise stock market pricing and issued directives to settle all approved government payables and invoices within 15 working days.","The General Administration of Abu Dhabi Customs rolled out an economic stimulus package to offset the impact of the coronavirus on businesses who use the emirate's ports for imports or as a transit gateway.

42,first abu dhabi bank,05-05-2020,"Covid-19 is the most serious public health and economic emergency the world has faced in modern times.

The impact on the global economy will be severe and long-lasting. The eventual outcome depends on actions taken now by various political and economic participants and stakeholders.

In the UAE, the government has acted quickly to protect its population from the virus and has taken steps to mitigate and contain the threat to public health. It is also ramping up its health system to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to treat patients and manage the crisis.

The government has also announced an emergency stimulus plan to support the economy and mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 shock by supporting lenders and UAE based businesses.

Fiscal policy is key to shoring up the country’s economy. The UAE has introduced measures to defer government fees, defer loan payments and increase financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which contribute around 60 per cent of non-oil economic output and employ around 90 per cent of the private workforce.

As elsewhere around the world many SMEs are facing a sudden and significant drop in sales, supply chain disruption and cashflow constraints. They are also facing the impact of large corporates delaying supplier payments to conserve cash.

Over the last 10 years the UAE government has taken significant steps to boost the SME sector and increase its contribution to the economy. Access to finance and broader government support will help cushion the impact on SMEs.

The challenge now is how best to deliver this support.

Banks need to play a leading role in transmitting the government’s fiscal stimulus to the economy. Although more than 90 per cent of businesses, by number, in the UAE are SMEs, they account for only some 5 per cent of total bank lending.

In this situation, the non-banking financial sector - and institutions within it - can play an important and supportive role in acting as transmission entities to those companies, particularly SMEs, that need access to finance quickly.

As well as providing capital quickly and efficiently, non-banking financial institutions are ideally positioned to provide non-financial support including governance, talent management, mentorship and strategic advice.

There is a well-developed community of non-banking financial institutions in the UAE, including alternative asset managers, private equity firms and other independent investment firms. They tend to have specialist investment capabilities and are well placed to work closely with the government, to increase the rate of transmission.

The priority must be to make sure that every eligible business can access financing quickly and survive through the crisis.

It is equally important to increase access to capital in the form of subordinated loans and equity-like instruments.

This can be achieved by establishing a national strategic investment fund with local sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) acting as anchor investors and guarantors to other equity investors and lenders to the fund. A guarantee would make it easier and quicker for banks to lend to SMEs through the fund.

Though the government might become a bigger shareholder in the wider economy and the SME sector more specifically, the benefits would be twofold.

In the first instance, swift support will protect the economy by maintaining the highest level of employment possible in the absence of an income tax or social security system.

Second, if capital is made widely accessible, in a timely manner and is structured to avoid the burden of additional debt, good companies will be in the best position to bounce back, expanding their operations and driving the growth that will repair the economic damage wrought by Covid-19.

If we can deploy capital by involving the broader financial community, this will amplify the economic impact and strengthen the UAE as a leading financial centre. In seeking to mitigate the social and economic impact of the virus, the UAE has an opportunity to maintain its world class environment - retaining the best of human capital, technology, entrepreneurship, resources and business ideas.

43,first abu dhabi bank,04-05-2020,"Eoin Morgan wants to see Jos Buttler involved when the Aldar Properties Abu Dhabi T10 returns in November.

Despite the scheduling issues affecting world cricket brought about by coronavirus, the next season of T10 has been confirmed for November 19-28.

That means a start date four days after the World T20 final is scheduled in Australia.

Morgan was the captain of Kerala Kings when they won the first T10 league tournament in Sharjah in 2017, and has been an ever present in the seasons since.

Although a number of his fellow England World Cup winners, like Jonny Bairstow, Liam Plunkett and Moeen Ali, have played T10 in the past three years, Buttler has been conspicuous by his absence.

The winter schedule for all teams is unclear at present, but Morgan is hoping there is a window for his big-hitting colleague to join the event in the capital.

“I’d love to see Jos Buttler playing T10,” Morgan said.

“The tournament has been going for long enough now that every international cricketer knows about it.

“It is a part of the calendar that guys, if they are available to play – providing they are not playing all three formats of the game internationally – they will try and get there.

“It is incredibly fun. It brings with it a feel good, freestyle attitude. Every cricketer wants to play with that modern attitude.

“If I was picking one player out of our team to come to play, it would be Jos Buttler.”

It is incredibly fun. It brings with it a feel good, freestyle attitude. Every cricketer wants to play with that modern attitude

There is already certain to be a logjam of tournaments vying for airtime later this year, with the entire Indian Premier League, as well as the playoff phase of the Pakistan Super League, suspended indefinitely.

Although the future of the game remains clouded by the global health situation, Morgan said he had become increasingly optimistic in recent days that there could be cricket played during the English season.

It has been suggested there could be six Test matches played – three each against West Indies and Pakistan – at two “bio-secure” venues.

Morgan and the rest of the England players were due to discuss the latest developments with the England and Wales Cricket Board on Monday afternoon.

England’s limited-overs captain expects football will take the lead in returning to action first, suggesting they will take “incredibly drastic measures to make safety a priority”.

“In the past month, everybody has struggled to get a sense of what might be possible, and what might or might not happen,” Morgan said.

“The ECB, along with the government, are trying to make everything they can possible and bio secure for us to play, hopefully international cricket to start with, then on top of that some county cricket as well.”

However the logistics are worked out is likely to have a knock on effect on player availability for the T10.

Morgan, though, is focused on a return to a format he says he enjoys – and one that he reckons it is possible to strategise for.

“Last year, with the Delhi Bulls, we didn’t have enough guys in form at the top of the order to capitalise on [the Powerplays], and equally we didn’t bowl well enough in those overs,” Morgan said.

“Playing at a new ground [Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi] this season gives it better characteristics. In Sharjah, it was really crash, bang, wallop.

“This season, the characteristics of the wicket changed day by day. That was probably a good thing.

“Strategy-wise, a little bit like T20, you need to identify the most important parts of the game.

“In T20, it depends who you are playing against, but in the majority of T20 games, the most important part is overs 10 to 20.

“If you look at a T10 game, the earlier overs are the most important. You need to make the most of that very short Powerplay.""","Eoin Morgan wants to see Jos Buttler involved when the Aldar Properties Abu Dhabi T10 returns in November.

44,first abu dhabi bank,04-05-2020,"Abu Dhabi-based Gulf Marine Services rejected a takeover approach from its shareholder Seafox International, arguing that the offer of $0.09 per share announced last Thursday was ""wholly opportunistic"" and undervalued the business.

The company said the offer had been made ""at a time of significant macro uncertainty"" caused by the Covid-19 outbreak which had depressed share prices globally, including its own.

The offer, which values the company at $31.54 million (Dh115.8m), ""fails to reflect the significant operational and financial progress made over the last 12 months and GMS's materially improved long-term prospects"", it said in a statement on Monday.

""The company is performing well notwithstanding the difficult environment; we have reduced costs and we will continue to reduce them further in 2020,"" executive chairman Tim Summers said.

On Friday, London-listed GMS reported its losses had widened to $85.5m for 2019, up from $5.1m last year. However, $59.1m of this was due to asset impairments on its fleet, with $5m being set aside for an older vessel that was scrapped, Mr Summers told The National. Revenue fell 11.8 per cent to $108.7m.

“The most important thing is, I think, ebitda delivery, that was just higher than the guidance we gave last year. In the context of a difficult marketplace it’s a very solid set of results,” he argued.

The company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation stood at $51.4m, compared to $58m in the prior year, but 2019 was a year of transformation for the company that saw its former board and management replaced, a major cost-cutting exercise being launched and a renegotiation of its bank debts following a breach of its covenants in late 2018.

A new deal with lenders agreed at the end of March, extends the company’s existing debts of almost $400m and provides up to $50m of working capital. Legal documentation is still being finalised, but is expected to complete by the end of June, Mr Summers said.

“The first quarter of this year was slightly better than our business plan and 83 per cent of our planned revenues for 2020 are covered under existing contracts,” Mr Summers said.

However, in a follow-up statement on Monday, Seafox International - which holds a 13.7 per cent stake in GMS - said the company still faced a number of challenges, including a likely requirement of further capital.

The Netherlands-based Seafox pointed to the current Covid-19 outbreak and the slump in global oil prices, adding that ""in the last sustained period of depressed oil prices, GMS saw its secured backlog fall by over 75 per cent in just one year (from $615.9 million in November 2015 to just $137.3m in November 2016)"".

Seafox argued the company's current backlog of $240m ""may face some deterioration, especially in the short and medium term"" and that the company had been forced to renegotiate its bank debts with lender every year since its IPO four years ago ""at a material cost to its shareholders"".

It said the company's current net debt of $390m equates to an ""adjusted ebitda multiple of more than 7.5x"" as at the end of last year. The agreement with lenders gives it space to execute its business plan ""but requires significant deleveraging"" to avoid heavy additional penalties either through the exercise of warranties or imposition of higher interest PIK notes.","Abu Dhabi-based Gulf Marine Services rejected a takeover approach from its shareholder Seafox International, arguing that the offer of $0.09 per share announced last Thursday was ""wholly opportunistic"" and undervalued the business.

45,first abu dhabi bank,04-05-2020,"The regulatory body for accountancy practices in the UK, the Financial Reporting Council, is investigating EY's 2018 audit of NMC Health, the UAE's biggest private healthcare company that was placed into administration last month.

""On 15 April 2020 the Financial Reporting Council opened an investigation into the audit by Ernst and Young of the financial statements of NMC Health for the year ended 31 December 2018,"" the regulator said in a statement on Monday. The investigation will be conducted by the FRC’s Enforcement Division under the Audit Enforcement Procedure.

Investigations into NMC Health are taking place both in the UAE and the UK, as the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange until its shares were suspended in February after an independent investigation of the company highlighted ""suspected fraudulent behaviour"". The UK's Financial Conduct Authority announced its own investigation into the company in the same month.

In a statement sent to The National on Monday, EY confirmed it had been notified of the FRC's intention to launch an investigation into its audit of the company for the 2018 financial year.

""We will be fully cooperating with the FRC during their enquiries. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,"" a spokeswoman for the accountancy firm said.

NMC Health was placed into administration last month following a petition from its largest lender, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, but its hospitals, clinics and pharmacies are continuing to operate.

Problems at the company were first highlighted after short seller Muddy Waters Research issued a report in December arguing the company had inflated cash balances, overpaid for assets and understated its debt.

ADCB petitioned for administrators to be appointed after the company disclosed its debt pile stood at $6.6bn, materially higher than the $2.1bn reported in the company's last set of accounts.

Last month ADCB said it ""initiated criminal legal proceeding with the Attorney General in Abu Dhabi against a number of individuals in relation to NMC Health Group"".

Last week, NMC’s founder BR Shetty said “serious fraud and wrongdoing” appears to have taken place at the company, as well as at currency and payments group Finablr and at several of his privately-owned companies.

“This fraud also appears to have been undertaken by a small group of current and former executives at these companies,” Mr Shetty said.

The fraud involved the creation of bank accounts, loans and personal guarantees in his name, he said, which he ""neither authorised, consented to, or had any knowledge of"".

46,first abu dhabi bank,04-05-2020,"The world currently faces four interconnected crises: public health, economic, energy and climate.

The number of unemployed Americans has increased to 30 million in the past month because of the coronavirus pandemic, wiping out all the jobs created in the past decade. The European Central Bank’s interest rate is at zero per cent and the US Federal Reserve is nearly the same. American oil prices recently went into negative territory.

These crazy numbers tell us it is time to focus less on anti-fossil fuel campaigns, and more on massive investment in a clean, new energy economy.

First, of course, we have to control the spread of the coronavirus and, hopefully, develop effective treatments and vaccines. Nothing constructive can happen until then. Once that happens, some countries will face the equivalent of recovering after an economic heart-attack, with mass unemployment, debt and corporate bankruptcies.

The International Monetary Fund said last month that the global economy was set to slide into the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Oil and gas exporters are enduring record low prices. The East Asian manufacturing giants will suffer while important markets in Europe and North America remain partially locked down.

Even before the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009, some economists argued the developed countries had entered a phase of “secular stagnation”, with slow growth because technological innovation was running out.

After the financial crisis, recovery was slow and patchy, and stored up problems of government debt despite or because of painful austerity, and social and regional inequality. In turn, these have yielded toxic politics, international hostility, trade barriers and populist leaders floundering in face of the virus. That experience cannot be repeated.

During the Great Depression, US President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal put a priority on infrastructure and energy. The Tennessee Valley Authority, set up in 1933, built dams and hydroelectric power stations through the south-east. The Hoover Dam on the Colorado River, then the world’s largest hydroelectric dam, was finished in 1936. The Rural Electrification Administration, established in 1935, took the share of farms with electricity from 10 per cent to 90 per cent by Mr Roosevelt’s death in 1945.

Before the coronavirus crisis, two New Deal-inspired environmental investment programmes had been proposed - the Green New Deal by some Democratic politicians in the US, and the European Green Deal to make the European Union carbon-neutral by 2050.

The Democrats’ agenda includes energy efficiency, smart grids, a move towards all renewable power, public transport, high-speed rail and clean manufacturing.

The European plan covers not just energy but also forest management and support to ensure farmers store carbon in soil, revitalise rural areas and revive natural habitats. It also includes carbon tariffs on imports from countries not managing their greenhouse gas emissions.

Similar initiatives are crucial, not just in the US and EU, but worldwide. The International Energy Agency estimates greenhouse gas emissions this year will fall by 8 per cent. Probably, 2019 will prove to have been the year in which carbon emissions hit an all-time high.

But emissions will first rebound from this year’s low level, before falling only slowly – too slowly to arrest the build-up of atmospheric carbon dioxide and hold global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Solar, wind and efficient gas power are now cheaper than coal in most locations. Nevertheless, coal power will continue to operate unless the funds are there to replace it. Coal mines provide local jobs and fund governments.

Climate rhetoric needs to shift. Environmental groups have pushed for laws to ban investment into fossil fuel projects. With Japan expected to join this movement, China is almost the last source of state financing for international coal, while the European Investment Bank’s policy, announced in November, effectively prevents funding even gas-fired power plants.

Commercial banks, insurers and equipment suppliers face pressure to withdraw from carbon fuels, with German industrial company Siemens confronting hostility in January over a relatively small contract to supply rail equipment to an Australian coal mine.

Yet, divestment campaigners have it exactly the wrong way around. Instead of trying to block fossil fuel investment, they should be removing the barriers to low-carbon energy. If a pension fund or a university divests from fossil fuels, it should commit twice as much to low-carbon technologies.

About $330 billion (Dh1.2 trillion) was invested in renewables in 2019. But the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi estimates this has to rise to $737bn annually by 2030 to meet climate targets. Governments do not have to invest all this themselves; they need to create the conditions to encourage private capital. Low interest rates and high unemployment create both the reward and the urgency to act.

In April, Shell and Equinor cut their dividends. In Shell’s case, this was the first time since the Second World War. This recognises the unique severity of the Covid-19 crisis. But it also frees up cash for investment in new growth areas such as offshore wind farms, electricity networks, batteries and hydrogen.

The role of governments is still essential. Prices for emitting carbon dioxide need to be imposed where they don’t exist and be raised where they do. The state should underwrite fundamental research and selectively pre-invest in areas such as surveys for offshore wind sites. Breakthrough technology needs finance, especially for the first large-scale demonstration projects such as advanced nuclear reactors, hydrogen production and low-carbon steel and cement plants, and new carbon capture systems.

Crucial infrastructure such as electric vehicle charging, hydrogen distribution, carbon capture hubs and high-voltage continental super grids needs government to lead. These massive, intricate projects require international co-operation to share the risk, to maximise value and avoid wasteful duplication. Our quadruple crisis outweighs the Great Depression in suddenness and complexity, but we can still learn from its solutions to build our own green future.

47,first abu dhabi bank,03-05-2020,"A number of US law firms filed class action lawsuits with a view to representing investors who might have suffered losses following the downfall of NMC Health.

Bernstein Liebherd, Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, Gainey, McKenna & Egleston, Pomerantz Law, Schall Law and Wolf Hadenstein Adler Freeman & Herz are six firms that have filed class action suits in courts on behalf of US investors alleging securities fraud.

Other firms are encouraging investors, who have lost $100,000 (Dh367,000) or more on NMC Health American Depository Receipts (ADRs) – a way for US stakeholders to invest in companies listed on the London Stock Exchange – to come forward with a view to representing them.

The filings make a number of allegations, including that the company lacked effective internal controls, that it engaged in “undisclosed and extensive” related party transactions, and that its debts were significantly understated, while cash balances were overstated.

At least one filing alleges that previous statements made by the company “were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis”.

NMC Health was placed into administration last month following a petition from its largest lender, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.

Joint administrators Richard Fleming, Mark Firmin and Ben Cairns from Alvarez & Marsal Europe were appointed to run the business, whose group companies continue to operate, but whose shares have been delisted from the London Stock Exchange as a cost-saving measure, and to simplify the restructuring process, administrators said last week.

Administrators declined to comment on the cases filed in the US.

Even if they were to be successful, any claim against the company from shareholders might not be paid given the scale of its debts. Claims from equity holders typically rank below those of secured and unsecured lenders, Kevin Lucas, an insolvency practitioner at UK-based Lucas Johnson, told The National.

“As a shareholder in the UK, you have a right to money after creditors have been paid – you’re not entitled to anything before that, unless part of your investment was a bond investment, rather than equity,” Mr Lucas explained.

NMC Health owes $6.6 billion to lenders but had less than $5bn of assets on its balance sheet as of June 30 last year, according to its last filed accounts. That means banks themselves may not be paid in full.

“If the banks are going to suffer a shortfall, that means the likes of HMRC (the UK tax authority) and utilities companies aren’t going to get paid. If they’re not going to be paid, there’s nothing left for the shareholders,” Mr Lucas said.

However, he said it was unclear whether the law firms that have filed claims were taking action against the company or its directors.

If directors have taken action that is deemed to have prejudiced investors, they may be personally liable, Mr Lucas said.

NMC Health, which employs 2,000 doctors and almost 20,000 other staff, first hit problems in December when short seller Muddy Waters Research issued a report arguing the company had inflated cash balances, overpaid for assets and understated its debt.

The allegations sparked an independent investigation, which highlighted “suspected fraudulent behaviour” and revealed the $6.6bn debt pile, materially higher than the $2.1bn reported in the company's last set of accounts.

Last week, NMC’s founder BR Shetty said “serious fraud and wrongdoing” appears to have taken place at the company, as well as at currency and payments group Finablr and at several of his privately-owned companies.

“This fraud also appears to have been undertaken by a small group of current and former executives at these companies,” Mr Shetty said.

The fraud involved the creation of bank accounts, loans and personal guarantees in his name, he said, which he ""neither authorised, consented to, or had any knowledge of"".

Finablr, which is also listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported on Friday that its debt is almost $1bn higher than previously reported.

The first phase of the project will include villas, a private beach, a marina and a wellness retreat.

Dhabi Contracting will construct 146 residential and two show villas over a total area of 5.78 hectares at Sahel al Emarat, Imkan said on Sunday. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2022.

“Our priority in choosing a construction partner for this project was to work with one that shares our ethos and beliefs,” said Imkan’s chief executive Walid El Hindi. “We are confident that Dhabi will play a vital role in the smooth delivery of Al Jurf to the best standard while – most importantly –protecting Al Jurf’s natural habitat and ecosystem.”

Set up in 1983, Dhabi Contracting's project portfolio includes Al Khail Avenue Mall, Adnoc’s villas in Ruwais and Le Royal Meridian Abu Dhabi .

“As a company that has played a major role in the growth of the UAE, with its numerous specialised developments, we will be drawing on our unrivalled expertise to bring to life this premium lifestyle concept,” said Dhabi Contracting’s general manager Samy Edward.

Al Jurf will also house Sha Emirates, a branch of European wellness clinic and retreat, Sha Wellness.

A wholly owned subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Capital Group, Imkan has a portfolio of 26 projects worth Dh100 billion in different countries such as the UAE, Egypt, Morocco, Seychelles and Sri Lanka.

Last year, it launched Le Carrousel, a 10ha development along the Atlantic coast in Morocco. The total investment in the mixed-use project is 1.5bn Moroccan dirhams (Dh558 m).

The company is also looking to expand in Egypt, where it purchased a 67.17ha plot from the Egyptian government to develop a mixed-use project in New Cairo near the American University campus for 4bn Egyptian pounds (Dh934 m) last year.

In Abu Dhabi, Imkan's projects under development include Pixel, a mixed-use scheme in its Makers District development on Reem Island; Nudra, a luxury beachside villa community; and Sheikha Fatima Park, with retail and food and beverage outlets.

The UAE's real estate market is expected to face strong headwinds in the near term due to the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices, consultancy Core said in a report last month.

However, the stimulus measures introduced by authorities are expected to help the property sector recover from the current situation.

The UAE Central Bank introduced a Dh100bn stimulus package this year, and later increased it to Dh256bn.

49,first abu dhabi bank,03-05-2020,"The National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah (RAKBank) reported a 43 per cent drop in first-quarter net profit on higher provisions for expected loan losses as a coronavirus-linked economic slowdown ensues.

Net profit attributable to owners of the bank for the three months ending March 31 declined to Dh153 million, the lender said in a statement to the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, where its shares trade. Profit for the period fell “due to higher IFRS 9 provisions that are set as precautionary measures to combat the economic impact of the novel coronavirus"", the lender said.

Net provision for credit loss climbed 39 per cent year-on-year to Dh480.4m. Net interest income and net income from Islamic financing also rose almost 2 per cent to Dh696m, while non-interest income dropped 4 per cent to Dh305m during the period.

“Like most banks globally we have taken the pre-emptive judgemental overlays in our IFRS 9 provisions to factor in the challenges that lie ahead, which has led to additional provisions of just over Dh130m for the quarter,” RAKBank chief executive Peter England said in a statement.

“RAKBank is very well positioned to weather the current challenges with very high levels of capital, liquidity and precautionary provisions, leaving us in a very strong position to help our clients through these very challenging times.”

General and administrative expenses of the bank dropped 4.49 per cent year-on-year to Dh367.2m.

Total assets at the end of the first quarter grew 4.6 per cent to Dh59.8bn, but loans and advances dropped almost 1 per cent from the end of the last year to Dh34.3bn. Customer deposits increased 3 per cent to Dh37.8bn during the first three months of 2020.

Lenders worldwide are facing a decline in profitability as loan growth slows and interest rates fall as central banks embark on monetary easing measures to support their economies.

The global economy is facing its deepest recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s and is projected to shrink 3 per cent in 2020, the International Monetary Fund said last month. The outlook is worse than the 2008 financial crisis and the IMF does not expect a recovery to take place before 2021.

The UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, has rolled out Dh282bn in fiscal and monetary support, including a Dh256bn package of measures from the central bank, which has provided zero interest funding to banks to encourage lending growth, as well as relaxing capital and liquidity buffers. Other government initiatives range from discounted utility bills to postponement and waivers of various fees.

“We are continuously monitoring the developments of Covid-19 and are always prepared to support our customers facing financial hardship or loss of income due to its economic impact on individuals, SMEs and corporates, including elimination or reduction of many fees and rates,” Mr England added.

“These measures were made possible with the support of the Central Bank of the UAE’s financial stimulus packages that directly benefitted customers by relieving them of their financial burdens during the health crisis.”","The National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah (RAKBank) reported a 43 per cent drop in first-quarter net profit on higher provisions for expected loan losses as a coronavirus-linked economic slowdown ensues.

50,abu dhabi commercial bank,10-05-2020,"Abu Dhabi is introducing an initiative to boost exports from the emirate to 60 target markets worldwide in an effort to further expand its foreign trade.

The new digital platform, Abu Dhabi Export Gateway, will “offer an integrated approach” to exporting at least 100 local products from 10 different sectors, the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development said on Sunday.

The new project will further support local export companies. It will also expand their contribution to the emirate’s gross domestic product as efficiency, export capacity and investments improve, Mohammed Ali Al Shorafa, chairman of the department, said.

The first phase of the Abu Dhabi Export Gateway is set to be launched in August.

“The platform will cover more than 100 local products across 10 different sectors and industries and is designed to accommodate expansion as local exporters may add more products they wish to promote via the platform.”

The new platform will also provide statistics on local exports and information about the economic performance of crucial sectors in Abu Dhabi and the UAE.

Mr Al Shorafa said the 60 target markets across the world were chosen based on the emirate’s established connections, economic relations and mutual trade.

The team managing the project will frequently review the needs of local companies and demand in foreign markets during the next six months, Ghanem Al Mazrouei, the department's executive director of international economic relations, said.

“Based on the results, the platform will add other global markets and target sectors, as well as a range of smart digital services that would enhance local companies’ exporting capabilities and practices.”

The unveiling of the platform comes as the UAE launches new measures to support exporters affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, Etihad Credit Insurance, a federal entity, said it would extend export credit insurance and additional funding to exporters and businesses facing payment and supply chain disruptions.

It is offering financial support to domestic companies through bank loans.

Abu Dhabi also waived Dh246 million in penalties to support small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the commercial and industrial sectors earlier this year.

The waived fines are related to various economic infractions including licence renewal delays, engaging in additional economic activities not covered by an existing licence and the improper storage of goods in unsafe areas.","Abu Dhabi is introducing an initiative to boost exports from the emirate to 60 target markets worldwide in an effort to further expand its foreign trade.

51,abu dhabi commercial bank,07-05-2020,"Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad), a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Ports, rolled out new relief packages that provide up to 36 per cent savings for businesses operating in the freezone in an effort to support its customers amid Covid-19.

The new measures, available to both existing and prospective customers, offer savings of up to 25 per cent on new registrations and renewals while security deposit charges will be waived, Kizad said in a statement on Thursday.

“The SME relief packages we announced today are aligned with the UAE’s efforts to protect SMEs in the country from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic,” said Khalid Al Marzooqi, director commercial at Kizad.

“As one of the leading enablers of industry, it is our responsibility to provide businesses with the opportunities to be competitive in their respective markets.”

Companies that register or renew for three years will have 25 per cent in savings while those committing for two years will net 20 per cent in savings. One-year registrations will be able to avail just 15 per cent in savings, Kizad said.

The new initiative follows similar measures undertaken by Abu Dhabi Ports and implemented by Kizad to support customers affected by the global economic slowdown in the wake of Covid-19.

The measures announced by Abu Dhabi Ports recently include waiving penalties associated with the late renewal of licences in the second quarter of the year and rent deferment.

The UAE is gradually opening up after weeks of stay-at-home directives that were in place to contain the coronavirus. While malls and restaurants have had a phased opening in the country, remote working policies continue in an effort to adhere to social distancing.

Dubai Airport Freezone Authority (Dafza) on Thursday said it started a set of new initiatives to support its employees working remotely.

The new initiatives which include “Virtual Dafza staff forum’ are aimed at ensuring the continuity of business operations and enabling co-workers to effectively communicate, collaborate and share their achievements during this period, according to Dafza.

“Our initiatives aim to boost morale and provide support to our employees whilst they maintain social distancing, keeping spirits positive. This in turn drives the performance of all departments and the level of services, which our customers expect,” said Yousuf Behzad, assistant director-general of people growth and strategy at Dafza.

52,abu dhabi commercial bank,07-05-2020,"When Fahmi received the handover notice for his villa on Abu Dhabi’s Yas Island in mid-March, he faced a difficult decision: sell the property or apply for a mortgage to cover the outstanding balance.

Declining to give his full name, Fahmi looked into the rate over five years for a Dh2.5 million mortgage and found it to be expensive, costing “close to Dh180,000 in interest”.

Shortly thereafter, he came across a limited-time offer from the property developer Aldar through three lenders: a 1.99 per cent rate over five years with no application or valuation fees.

“Now with this offer, I’m only paying Dh113,000 over five years. You’re talking close to 40 per cent reduction,” says Fahmi. “It’s as cheap as getting a car loan.”

While he was leaning towards selling to free up capital amid the Covid-19 uncertainty, the “phenomenal” rate changed his mind.

I’ve been doing home finance in Dubai for 15 years now and it’s the lowest I’ve ever seen interest rates in the UAE Richard Boyd, director at Mortgage Finder

“When I looked at the mortgage rate and the monthly payments and the fact I’ve been here for 20 years paying rent, I thought ‘this is an opportune time for me to move to a house’,” he says.

As the coronavirus continues to spread worldwide and the global economy slips further into recession with millions of people losing their jobs, it may not seem like the opportune time to add the hefty financial commitment of paying for a mortgage.

However, favourable rates, fee waivers, a reduced loan-to-value ratio, bank payment holidays and the removal of the early settlement fee are all reasons to apply for a new home loan or renegotiate an existing one in the UAE.While there are factors to take into account, such as the decline of real estate prices in recent years and job security, mortgage brokers say property buyers should take advantage of exceptionally low borrowing costs.

“I’ve been doing home finance in Dubai for 15 years now and it’s the lowest I’ve ever seen interest rates in the UAE,” says Richard Boyd, director at Mortgage Finder, part of the Property Finder Group.

With the US Federal Reserve slashing its benchmark interest rates to near zero in emergency moves in March, the UAE has seen interest rates come down significantly in that period, given that the dirham is pegged to the dollar.

The Central Bank of the UAE lowered its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.5 per cent in early March and then cut its rate on one-week certificates of deposit by 75 basis points a couple of weeks later.

Banks, as a result, have become more competitive with their mortgage offers. ""The central bank interest cuts has enabled banks to offer longer lower fixed rates and people who are on variable rates will also have seen a decline in their monthly payments for the most part,” says Stuart Roe, head of mortgages at Allsopp & Allsopp real estate agency.

As part of the central bank’s Dh256 billion stimulus package, borrowers can also benefit from loan relief from their banks for up to six months, while first-time home buyers are eligible for a 5 per cent increase in the loan-to-value ratio (up to 80 per cent for expatriates and 85 per cent for UAE nationals) and a full waiver of processing fees.

Home buyers can now get a mortgage for the lowest fixed rate of 2.7 per cent for one year, say brokers. Fixed rates for three to five years range from 2.99 per cent to 3.5 per cent. That is about 25 per cent cheaper than 12 months ago, when an average three-year fixed rate mortgage was 3.99 per cent, says Mr Boyd.

Arran Summerhill, director of UAE mortgage broker Holo, says banks are also offering “headline rates” to further attract customers. These are often limited in time or to specific properties.

For example, the Aldar offer is only available for 30 days from April 20 and applies to customers who have already purchased or are looking to purchase homes in Yas Acres, The Bridges on Al Reem Island, and Mamsha and Jawaher on Al Saadiyat Island.

Homeowners in those communities were able to apply for financing through Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank. Although subject to terms and conditions and approval, the offer included a rate from 1.99 per cent, fixed for three or five years, and up to six months’ deferral on first instalments.

Lower real estate prices have also been an important factor encouraging people in the UAE to get on the property ladder. Prices have gone down between 20 to 40 per cent over the last couple of years, says Mr Summerhill.

“The stimulus package and the decrease in the rates and the lower prices has offset some of the uncertainty in the market,” he says.

Over the last two months, mortgage applications through the Holo site have grown threefold. About 60 per cent are applications to refinance. Another trend is that about 80 per cent of applicants are end users, rather than investors, Mr Summerhill adds.

Mortgage Finder has seen a 15 per cent increase in mortgage applications in the first quarter of this year, compared to the same period in 2019. While there was a slight reduction during the coronavirus lockdown period, the numbers have gone up since movement restrictions were eased, Mr Boyd says.

Refinancing accounts for much of the increase in mortgage applications, according to brokers.

“Some clients are stuck still paying anywhere from 5 to 6 per cent, so potentially there’s good savings to switch,” Mr Boyd says.

In October, the central bank removed the 3 per cent early settlement fee for mortgages introduced in 2018 and reverted to a 1 per cent or Dh10,000 cap, whichever is lower.

Combined with low interest rates and increased lending, “it’s suddenly become a lot more relevant to look at refinancing the loans that they’ve had”, says Mr Summerhill.

There are some factors to consider, however, including the decline in property values, the percentage borrowed, the outstanding amount and the fees associated with moving to another lender.

“The downsides of switching mortgage lenders are that some people may not be able to leverage their position if their outstanding amount is less than 75 per cent of the value,” says Mr Roe.

It is still worth investigating, says Mr Summerhill. A valuation costs Dh2,500 to Dh3,500, but homeowners can get a free estimate of the value of their home at homevalue.ai.

However, it is at the discretion of banks how much to lend up to the maximum ratio, whether for a new mortgage or refinancing. As businesses and others affected by Covid-19 look to release equity from properties, some banks have reacted by limiting the amount, says Mr Summerhill.

“Some banks were only going up to 20 per cent as a maximum and they wanted to see if that was being used for property renovations,” he says. Other banks put a 50 per cent cap on “cash out”, while still others have been happy to lend at the normal limits of up to 80 per cent for a first property or up to 60 per cent for a second.

In these uncertain times, job security is another key consideration. “If you’ve lost your job and you’ve actually signed to buy a property, then that can be tricky because the bank may recall the finance offer,” says Mr Boyd.

The good news is that banks are being more flexible, with some lenders willing to offer “interest-only for up to a year to help”, he says. Even clients whose salaries have been cut have had mortgage applications approved, but it depends on the bank. Home buyers in hard-hit industries such as aviation and oil & gas may also get rejected.

For Fahmi, a senior manager with a UAE company, it helped that he had a “good standing” with his bank ADCB to apply for the mortgage.

53,abu dhabi commercial bank,06-05-2020,"A new digital collection of historical photographs offers glimpses of Palestine during the end of the Ottoman rule and the period after the First World War.

The Nasri Fuleihan Collection comprises more than 350 photographs by Nasri Fuleihan, who worked as an engineer in Palestine and helped exploring for oil in the Middle East.

His photographs, taken between 1912 and 1924, can be viewed online thanks to Akkasah, NYU Abu Dhabi’s (NYUAD) Centre for Photography, which digitises photos from the region that documents day-to-day life. The collections are shared on the centre’s website for the public to browse and for researchers to use as resources.

Born in 1891, Fuleihan was a Cypriot of Lebanese descent who studied Civil Engineering at Purdue University. After graduating in 1912, he traveled to Jordan, Palestine and Egypt and worked as an engineer in Southern Palestine at the Levant Producing Company.

During that period, Palestine was under Ottoman rule, which lasted until 1917 . In one photo, the Ottoman flag can be seen on a boat sailing along the coast of Jaffa.

Fuleihan was able to capture everyday life in Palestine, as seen in his photographs of women grinding wheat outside of a building or a priest praying in a grotto in Jerusalem. He also documented the lives of workers involved in his infrastructure projects.

He was inspired by Palestinian photographer Khalil Ra'd, whose studio he visited in Jerusalem.

The engineer also worked for the American company Standard Oil, which explored the area for oil deposits even before the war.

The company eventually ran into conflict with the British Mandate, which controlled Palestine from 1920 to 1948. Fuleihan returned to the United States in 1924, where he worked on projects such as the Holland Tunnel and George Washington Bridge. He died in New York in 1959.

Akkasah’s collection came out of a collaboration between the collection owner Gail O'Keefe Edson, Fuleihan's granddaughter, and librarian Guy Burak from the NYU Elmer Holmes Bobst Library in New York. The photographs were loaned to the library and digitised there, while the Akkasah team researched and catalogued the digital images.

Jasmine Soliman, an archivist from Akkasah who conducted research on the photographs, said: “Fuleihan's photographs tell the story of his life and career among the Middle Eastern diaspora in the United States; beginning with his time studying alongside classmates from as far afield as Japan and the Philippines and later returning to the Levant.

""There he carved out a successful career and developed a network among leaders in Palestinian society, including Selim Ayoub and Ismail Bey el Husseini, officers of the Jerusalem Chamber of Commerce and Commercial Society of Palestine Bank.”

Currently, Akkasah has 33,000 photographs in its archive, with more 10,000 images digitised and available to the public on their website.","A new digital collection of historical photographs offers glimpses of Palestine during the end of the Ottoman rule and the period after the First World War.

54,abu dhabi commercial bank,06-05-2020,"The General Administration of Abu Dhabi Customs rolled out an economic stimulus package to offset the impact of the coronavirus on businesses who use the emirate's ports for imports or as a transit gateway.

The new incentives include the postponement of customs duties for 90 days for importers through facilities accounts and the acceptance of institutional guarantees, instead of bank guarantees, for customs transactions.

Importers can also use pre-clearance services for clearing goods before they arrive in the country through the customs operations system. A self-clearance service allows companies to clear shipments on their own without relying on customs clearance and bond warehouses can be licenced without fees, the statement said. Companies can also issue a customs warehouse licence without the need to pay licence fees and can take items from customs warehouses without paying services fees, according to a statement.

The incentive package also includes the extension of the transit period of shipments from 3 to 5 days.

“The economic incentives package comes within the framework of Abu Dhabi government efforts to support continuously the economic system and companies, especially small and medium ones, in order to enhance the competitiveness of the emirate of Abu Dhabi and ensure business continuity for companies in all sectors,” Rashed Al Mansoori, director-general of the general administration of Abu Dhabi Customs, said.

The UAE was the first country in the Mena region to roll out fiscal and monetary support now totalling more than Dh282 billion, providing zero interest funding to encourage banks to lend in addition to a variety of other initiatives that range from discounted utility bills to waivers of government fees.

In March, the Abu Dhabi government announced a number of measures to support businesses in the emirate. The government allocated Dh5bn to subsidising water and electricity for citizens and commercial and industrial activities. It also reduced electricity connection fees for start-ups until the end of this year and exempted all commercial and industrial activities from Tawtheeq fees in 2020.

The emirate also allocated Dh3bn for an SME credit guarantee scheme, dedicated Dh1bn to establish a market maker fund to stabilise stock market pricing and issued directives to settle all approved government payables and invoices within 15 working days.","The General Administration of Abu Dhabi Customs rolled out an economic stimulus package to offset the impact of the coronavirus on businesses who use the emirate's ports for imports or as a transit gateway.

55,abu dhabi commercial bank,04-05-2020,"The regulatory body for accountancy practices in the UK, the Financial Reporting Council, is investigating EY's 2018 audit of NMC Health, the UAE's biggest private healthcare company that was placed into administration last month.

""On 15 April 2020 the Financial Reporting Council opened an investigation into the audit by Ernst and Young of the financial statements of NMC Health for the year ended 31 December 2018,"" the regulator said in a statement on Monday. The investigation will be conducted by the FRC’s Enforcement Division under the Audit Enforcement Procedure.

Investigations into NMC Health are taking place both in the UAE and the UK, as the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange until its shares were suspended in February after an independent investigation of the company highlighted ""suspected fraudulent behaviour"". The UK's Financial Conduct Authority announced its own investigation into the company in the same month.

In a statement sent to The National on Monday, EY confirmed it had been notified of the FRC's intention to launch an investigation into its audit of the company for the 2018 financial year.

""We will be fully cooperating with the FRC during their enquiries. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,"" a spokeswoman for the accountancy firm said.

NMC Health was placed into administration last month following a petition from its largest lender, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, but its hospitals, clinics and pharmacies are continuing to operate.

Problems at the company were first highlighted after short seller Muddy Waters Research issued a report in December arguing the company had inflated cash balances, overpaid for assets and understated its debt.

ADCB petitioned for administrators to be appointed after the company disclosed its debt pile stood at $6.6bn, materially higher than the $2.1bn reported in the company's last set of accounts.

Last month ADCB said it ""initiated criminal legal proceeding with the Attorney General in Abu Dhabi against a number of individuals in relation to NMC Health Group"".

Last week, NMC’s founder BR Shetty said “serious fraud and wrongdoing” appears to have taken place at the company, as well as at currency and payments group Finablr and at several of his privately-owned companies.

“This fraud also appears to have been undertaken by a small group of current and former executives at these companies,” Mr Shetty said.

The fraud involved the creation of bank accounts, loans and personal guarantees in his name, he said, which he ""neither authorised, consented to, or had any knowledge of"".

Finablr, which is also listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported on Friday that its debt is almost $1bn higher than previously reported. It has debts of $1.3bn, as compared with $334.1 million in its last filed accounts for the six months to June 30, 2019.

EY resigned as auditor of Finablr on March 29, citing ""concerns arising out of recent events at the company and NMC Health … the composition of the board of the company, the adequacy of corporate governance concerns and the recent issues that have caused the company to commission an independent review"" of its finances, including related party transactions and off-balance sheet debts.

Mr Shetty still co-chairs and is majority shareholder of Finablr. The company said EY informed it a number of changes have to be made to the composition of Finablr board, as a condition of it continuing to act as its auditor.

Finablr said its board had been ""unable to accommodate EY's requirements in full in the time allowed to them"".","The regulatory body for accountancy practices in the UK, the Financial Reporting Council, is investigating EY's 2018 audit of NMC Health, the UAE's biggest private healthcare company that was placed into administration last month.

56,abu dhabi commercial bank,04-05-2020,"The world currently faces four interconnected crises: public health, economic, energy and climate.

The number of unemployed Americans has increased to 30 million in the past month because of the coronavirus pandemic, wiping out all the jobs created in the past decade. The European Central Bank’s interest rate is at zero per cent and the US Federal Reserve is nearly the same. American oil prices recently went into negative territory.

These crazy numbers tell us it is time to focus less on anti-fossil fuel campaigns, and more on massive investment in a clean, new energy economy.

First, of course, we have to control the spread of the coronavirus and, hopefully, develop effective treatments and vaccines. Nothing constructive can happen until then. Once that happens, some countries will face the equivalent of recovering after an economic heart-attack, with mass unemployment, debt and corporate bankruptcies.

The International Monetary Fund said last month that the global economy was set to slide into the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Oil and gas exporters are enduring record low prices. The East Asian manufacturing giants will suffer while important markets in Europe and North America remain partially locked down.

Even before the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009, some economists argued the developed countries had entered a phase of “secular stagnation”, with slow growth because technological innovation was running out.

After the financial crisis, recovery was slow and patchy, and stored up problems of government debt despite or because of painful austerity, and social and regional inequality. In turn, these have yielded toxic politics, international hostility, trade barriers and populist leaders floundering in face of the virus. That experience cannot be repeated.

During the Great Depression, US President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal put a priority on infrastructure and energy. The Tennessee Valley Authority, set up in 1933, built dams and hydroelectric power stations through the south-east. The Hoover Dam on the Colorado River, then the world’s largest hydroelectric dam, was finished in 1936. The Rural Electrification Administration, established in 1935, took the share of farms with electricity from 10 per cent to 90 per cent by Mr Roosevelt’s death in 1945.

Before the coronavirus crisis, two New Deal-inspired environmental investment programmes had been proposed - the Green New Deal by some Democratic politicians in the US, and the European Green Deal to make the European Union carbon-neutral by 2050.

The Democrats’ agenda includes energy efficiency, smart grids, a move towards all renewable power, public transport, high-speed rail and clean manufacturing.

The European plan covers not just energy but also forest management and support to ensure farmers store carbon in soil, revitalise rural areas and revive natural habitats. It also includes carbon tariffs on imports from countries not managing their greenhouse gas emissions.

Similar initiatives are crucial, not just in the US and EU, but worldwide. The International Energy Agency estimates greenhouse gas emissions this year will fall by 8 per cent. Probably, 2019 will prove to have been the year in which carbon emissions hit an all-time high.

But emissions will first rebound from this year’s low level, before falling only slowly – too slowly to arrest the build-up of atmospheric carbon dioxide and hold global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Solar, wind and efficient gas power are now cheaper than coal in most locations. Nevertheless, coal power will continue to operate unless the funds are there to replace it. Coal mines provide local jobs and fund governments.

Climate rhetoric needs to shift. Environmental groups have pushed for laws to ban investment into fossil fuel projects. With Japan expected to join this movement, China is almost the last source of state financing for international coal, while the European Investment Bank’s policy, announced in November, effectively prevents funding even gas-fired power plants.

Commercial banks, insurers and equipment suppliers face pressure to withdraw from carbon fuels, with German industrial company Siemens confronting hostility in January over a relatively small contract to supply rail equipment to an Australian coal mine.

Yet, divestment campaigners have it exactly the wrong way around. Instead of trying to block fossil fuel investment, they should be removing the barriers to low-carbon energy. If a pension fund or a university divests from fossil fuels, it should commit twice as much to low-carbon technologies.

About $330 billion (Dh1.2 trillion) was invested in renewables in 2019. But the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi estimates this has to rise to $737bn annually by 2030 to meet climate targets. Governments do not have to invest all this themselves; they need to create the conditions to encourage private capital. Low interest rates and high unemployment create both the reward and the urgency to act.

In April, Shell and Equinor cut their dividends. In Shell’s case, this was the first time since the Second World War. This recognises the unique severity of the Covid-19 crisis. But it also frees up cash for investment in new growth areas such as offshore wind farms, electricity networks, batteries and hydrogen.

The role of governments is still essential. Prices for emitting carbon dioxide need to be imposed where they don’t exist and be raised where they do. The state should underwrite fundamental research and selectively pre-invest in areas such as surveys for offshore wind sites. Breakthrough technology needs finance, especially for the first large-scale demonstration projects such as advanced nuclear reactors, hydrogen production and low-carbon steel and cement plants, and new carbon capture systems.

Crucial infrastructure such as electric vehicle charging, hydrogen distribution, carbon capture hubs and high-voltage continental super grids needs government to lead. These massive, intricate projects require international co-operation to share the risk, to maximise value and avoid wasteful duplication. Our quadruple crisis outweighs the Great Depression in suddenness and complexity, but we can still learn from its solutions to build our own green future.

57,abu dhabi commercial bank,03-05-2020,"A number of US law firms filed class action lawsuits with a view to representing investors who might have suffered losses following the downfall of NMC Health.

Bernstein Liebherd, Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, Gainey, McKenna & Egleston, Pomerantz Law, Schall Law and Wolf Hadenstein Adler Freeman & Herz are six firms that have filed class action suits in courts on behalf of US investors alleging securities fraud.

Other firms are encouraging investors, who have lost $100,000 (Dh367,000) or more on NMC Health American Depository Receipts (ADRs) – a way for US stakeholders to invest in companies listed on the London Stock Exchange – to come forward with a view to representing them.

The filings make a number of allegations, including that the company lacked effective internal controls, that it engaged in “undisclosed and extensive” related party transactions, and that its debts were significantly understated, while cash balances were overstated.

At least one filing alleges that previous statements made by the company “were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis”.

NMC Health was placed into administration last month following a petition from its largest lender, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.

Joint administrators Richard Fleming, Mark Firmin and Ben Cairns from Alvarez & Marsal Europe were appointed to run the business, whose group companies continue to operate, but whose shares have been delisted from the London Stock Exchange as a cost-saving measure, and to simplify the restructuring process, administrators said last week.

Administrators declined to comment on the cases filed in the US.

Even if they were to be successful, any claim against the company from shareholders might not be paid given the scale of its debts. Claims from equity holders typically rank below those of secured and unsecured lenders, Kevin Lucas, an insolvency practitioner at UK-based Lucas Johnson, told The National.

“As a shareholder in the UK, you have a right to money after creditors have been paid – you’re not entitled to anything before that, unless part of your investment was a bond investment, rather than equity,” Mr Lucas explained.

NMC Health owes $6.6 billion to lenders but had less than $5bn of assets on its balance sheet as of June 30 last year, according to its last filed accounts. That means banks themselves may not be paid in full.

“If the banks are going to suffer a shortfall, that means the likes of HMRC (the UK tax authority) and utilities companies aren’t going to get paid. If they’re not going to be paid, there’s nothing left for the shareholders,” Mr Lucas said.

However, he said it was unclear whether the law firms that have filed claims were taking action against the company or its directors.

If directors have taken action that is deemed to have prejudiced investors, they may be personally liable, Mr Lucas said.

NMC Health, which employs 2,000 doctors and almost 20,000 other staff, first hit problems in December when short seller Muddy Waters Research issued a report arguing the company had inflated cash balances, overpaid for assets and understated its debt.

The allegations sparked an independent investigation, which highlighted “suspected fraudulent behaviour” and revealed the $6.6bn debt pile, materially higher than the $2.1bn reported in the company's last set of accounts.

58,abu dhabi commercial bank,01-05-2020,"Payments and currency exchange group Finablr has uncovered $1 billion (Dh3.67bn) in previously unreported debt, which may have been used for purposes outside the company, it said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange.

The new findings by investment bank Houlihan Lokey and independent investigator Kroll raise the total indebtedness of the firm, excluding that of Travelex, to $1.3bn.

""This is materially above the last reported figure for the group's indebtedness position as at 30 June 2019 and the levels of indebtedness previously disclosed to the board,"" the company said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange earlier this week.

The company had previously reported net debt of $334.1m as at June 30, 2019, when it published results for the period in August last year.

Finablr and Houlihan Lokey ""intend to engage further with the group's creditors to explore the options that may be available to the group and its creditors"", the statement said.

Finablr is co-chaired and majority-owned by BR Shetty. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in May last year, giving it a valuation of $1.3bn.

However, in recent weeks it has reported liquidity problems and the operations of its UAE Exchange currency business are now being overseen by the country's central bank. Its shares were suspended from trading on March 16, by which time its value had fallen to £77.2m (Dh351.7m).

In March, Finablr's board revealed it had been made aware of cheques written by group companies before the initial public offering worth up to $100m ""which may have been used as security for financing arrangements for the benefit of third parties”.

The company's auditors, EY, resigned on March 30 after demanding changes to the composition of the board, which Finablr said it had been unable to meet within the required time.

Finablr's last filed accounts for the first half of 2019 showed a loss of $30.1m on group income of $733.6m.

Meanwhile, the company's billionaire owner Mr Shetty said in a statement last week that he was a victim of ""serious fraud and wrongdoing"".

Mr Shetty blamed the fraud on ""a small group of current and former executives"". He said bank accounts were created in his name and transactions were made without his knowledge.

Mr Shetty also said loans, cheques, and bank transfers were also fraudulently guaranteed in his name using his ""forged signature"" and that he ""neither authorised, consented to, or had any knowledge of"".

Alongside Finablr, Mr Shetty built NMC Health from a single clinic in Abu Dhabi in 1975 and grew it into the UAE's biggest private healthcare provider, with 2,000 doctors and almost 20,000 other staff operating clinics, hospitals and pharmacies in 19 countries.

The tax relief is aimed at businesses in the northern emirate that are affected as a result of stay-at-home directives which in turn led to their temporary closure, state news agency Wam said on Thursday.

""Some activities shall be exempted for a year, starting from January 1 to December 31, 2020, from licensing fees, such as professions in the popular market, Friday market, meat and poultry stores, tailors, cinemas, gaming centres and stores located in shopping malls, hotels, fitness centres, health clubs, wedding halls, and men's and women's salons,” Wam said, quoting a decree issued by Fujairah’s ruler Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi.

It has subsequently appointed investment bank Houlihan Lokey to advise on strategic options that could include a restructuring of its debt, a sale of some of its assets or a capital raise.

""My greatest regret is for the thousands of hardworking employees in the companies we established who are now enduring extreme uncertainty and hardship, especially during the current public health crisis,"" Mr Shetty said.

""It also pains me to see the damage caused to my business partners, shareholders and other stakeholders who we have worked with for so long. I intend to work tirelessly to clear my name and assist any authorities in getting to the truth"".

A look back at our interview with BR Shetty in July 2019","In a statement, Mr Shetty blamed the fraud on ""a small group of current and former executives at these companies"".
Mr Shetty also said loans, cheques and bank transfers were also fraudulently guaranteed in his name using his ""forged signature"" and that he ""neither authorised, consented to, or had any knowledge of"".
Problems with his empire first emerged in December when activist investor Muddy Waters, a short seller, issued a report saying NMC Health had inflated its cash balances, overpaid for its assets and understated its debt.
This sparked an independent investigation which found that debts at NMC Health were materially higher, at $6.6bn, than the $2.1bn previously stated in its accounts.

61,abu dhabi commercial bank,29-04-2020,"As business slowed before grinding to a halt at the end of March, Payal Mirchandani, the chief executive of Pinca Trading, watched as orders and payments dried up from the large retailers that buy from her.

She slashed the annual sales forecast for her business, which distributes toys and other children's products, while fielding emails and calls from retailers that wanted to extend payment terms, from 60 to 100 days. Then she turned to her banks for relief.

Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest ... Payal Mirchandani, Pinca Trading

Mashreq Bank, where she has a secured business loan, offered her a three-month payment holiday – a process she describes as quick and “pretty seamless”. Interest will still accrue during this period, but will be charged on the final payments. “Of course it would be great if they didn’t charge the interest at all, but I think it’s fair, and it’s still a support,” says Ms Mirchandani, from Canada who lives in Dubai.

RAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday. “They did their due diligence – they asked us a lot of questions, they wanted us to submit a lot documents. But they were supportive at the end, given that we could prove we had been affected,"" she says.

“Because we are a distributor selling to retailers, it’s a no-brainer – retailers were shut across the country.”

Ms Mirchandani says she breathed a sigh of relief when her banks said yes. “Payment collections are very difficult right now, and I don’t know if I would have been able to manage my cash flow if I didn’t get the support to be honest, I’m just grateful that I got it at the time that I did,"" she adds.

Borrowers across the country have benefited from loan relief from their banks, driven by the UAE Central Bank’s Dh50 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess), part of a Dh100bn package launched on March 14. The overall size of the stimulus was later increased to Dh256bn and by April 23, banks had allocated over 60 per cent of the Dh50bn Tess package, which equates to Dh30bn.

Personal loans

For some residents, the process of applying for debt relief has been very smooth. Omar Youssef works for Orora, an events company in Dubai, which has seen most of its business dry up during Covid-19 apart from its animation studio and work on digital campaigns.

He called HSBC where he has a personal loan and is a priority banking customer and asked for a payment holiday. Due to his 33 per cent salary reduction, the bank offered him a loan holiday of up to three months, without interest or fees, though he has to sign a document each month requesting the payment holiday for an additional month and attesting his income remains reduced.

“It was a very easy procedure,"" he says. ""They send you an online form to complete and sign, and attach the company letter saying you have a salary reduction.""

Dan Robinson, head of wealth and personal banking at HSBC UAE, said: ""Our customers have told us where they need our support most and we have made those areas our focus.""

Mr Youssef says some of his friends, who have had their incomes affected by Covid-19, did not apply for loan holidays because they thought it would be drawn-out process. “When I saw how easy it was I called my friend and told him he should do it as well,"" he says.

Most financial relief measures are broadly similar across banks in the country, says Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of the financial comparison website Souqalmal.com. Borrowers who have been financially affected by the pandemic and the resulting movement restrictions have access to penalty-free payment holidays on loans for up to three months, and interest-free instalment plans of up to six months on grocery purchases, school fee payments and utility bill payments made with credit cards, she says.

“Foreign banks have also introduced various financial relief measures, though these vary in structure and scale across individual banks,” Ms Musa adds.

Home loans

Mortgage payments are often the biggest single cost faced by home owners and therefore relief from these can ease a significant financial burden.

Natasha Hatherall-Shawe, who owns a marketing, PR and events agency in Dubai, says “overnight” the business lost around 70 per cent of its revenue, as well as facing a slowdown in client payments.

“It leaves our company cash flow in a very difficult place and I have 20 staff to pay and my priority is to make sure they are paid and OK,"" says the Briton, who lives in Dubai. ""All of my savings and personal money will go into filling the gap left from reduced revenue and clients not paying.""

She received a one-month holiday on her home mortgage with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, though interest will continue to accrue. She was advised by her bank that the remaining loan tenure may increase as an effect of the deferment, while service fees for the request were waived.

Ms Hatherall-Shawe says her bank has been responsive and helpful. ""I was disappointed at one month initially, but they [then said] that they did offer up more potentially if I met the criteria,"" she says. ""Given the nature of my business and the fact we are unlikely to get anywhere back to normal until September onwards, I am likely to apply.”

The process to receive a home loan deferment can be relatively straight forward, according to Arran Summerhill, director of Holo, a mortgage broker in Dubai. Banks typically want to receive an email detailing how the coronavirus has affected a borrower economically, including evidence such as a salary reduction letter, he says.

“We’ve tried with six different banks now. We’ve not had a bank that has come back and actually declined a client’s request,” he says.

Clients that have been able to secure deferments include a landlord with multiple units, who was able to receive a loan holiday from the bank partly because his tenants were telling him they were struggling to meet monthly rent payments.

Mr Summerhill, says the impact of a job loss or salary reduction will often be greater on a household than a landlord, who can be expected to have multiple revenue streams.

“We’ve had households who reached out to their lenders and they seem to be very grateful for the fact it’s been a fairly smooth process for the banks to agree these payment delays,” he says.

Haresh Lalwani, managing director at Right Move Mortgage Broker, believes it’s logical for banks to try to provide relief for borrowers at this time and says it is positive for a brand if a lender is proactive.

“People remember which bank supported them during the tough times,"" he says. ""So definitely, it’s a huge plus for them.”

Mr Lalwani benefited himself from a rent relief when his landlord, Sultan bin Ali Al Owais Real Estate. announced a 45-day rent waiver for its tenants at the end of March.

Credit cards

While relief on rents or loans is commonplace, the situation for credit card debt is also more variable, with some banks offering repayment holidays and others not.

Ms Musa says some banks are offering credit card customers the option to postpone their repayments by one month, with deferred interest, while other banks have also reduced their late payment fees on credit cards.

Cardholders may also be able to benefit from 0 per cent interest deals on balance transfers, she says. “Some banks are offering this interest-free deal for up to 12 months, making it a great way for cardholders to repay and settle their outstanding credit card debt faster,"" she adds.

Commercial Bank of Dubai (CBD) is offering a one-month payment holiday for all customers on credit cards and other loans. Customers affected by Covid-19 can also defer their instalments for up to three months.

So far CBD has helped 3,000 customers in the UAE, says Amit Malhotra, general manager, personal banking group. “We are one of the lead banks in the Dubai banks combined relief measures package offer, and we have also undertaken several other initiatives to support our customers during the current coronavirus pandemic,” he says.

Mashreq is also offering a payment holiday of up to three months with no extra fees or charges to “a sizeable number” of the bank’s credit card, home loan and personal loan customers, though current interest rates apply. The banks says it reaching out to these customers directly.

Not all debtors can secure relief from the banks, however. Borrowers who already defaulted on their loans before the crisis are not eligible for financial relief measures such as repayment holidays, despite the financial effects of the crisis worsening their situation, says Ms Musa. Non-residents do not qualify for relief either.

“It is best for such borrowers to approach their bank to see what debt relief options are available to them, and whether the bank can restructure their debts to make repayments more manageable,” she adds.","RAKBank, where she has a trade financing facility was more thorough in their checks to approve a payment holiday.

62,abu dhabi commercial bank,29-04-2020,"The government of Abu Dhabi is earmarking 15 per cent of procurement spending and annual contracts to micro, small and medium enterprises (mSMEs) from 2020 onwards to spur growth and offset the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

The aim is drive the growth of small businesses as “backbone of the economy”, the Abu Dhabi Media Office said in a tweet late on Tuesday evening.

Other measures to help smaller firms include the suspension of bid bonds and waivers of performance guarantees for projects worth up to Dh50 million, which are being introduced from this year onwards for mSMEs and Emirati entrepreneurs. These measures are being taken as part of the Ghadan 21 initiative, further tweets from the Media Office on Wednesday explained.

SMEs are a key component of Abu Dhabi’s business landscape, accounting for 98 per cent of all companies in the emirate, 29 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), and 44 per cent of the non-oil economy.

Abu Dhabi, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the world’s proven oil reserves, last month, rolled out an economic stimulus package to help soften the impact of the coronavirus on its economy. The economic relief scheme includes 16 initiatives aimed at reducing the costs of living and supporting businesses in the emirate.

Earlier in April Abu Dhabi’s department of finance teamed up with three of the emirate’s top lenders to expand the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme introduced as part of Abu Dhabi’s economic stimulus.

Under the deal with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and the country's biggest lender First Abu Dhabi Bank, the government is guaranteeing up to 80 per cent of the value of the scheme extended to SMEs, it said in an April 16 statement.

The pact provides SMEs with wider access to renewable financing options for working capital loans for a three-month duration and term loans for up to four-year duration to support further investment in Abu Dhabi, the department of finance said at the time.

The UAE, the Arab world's second-biggest economy, rolled out Dh282bn in fiscal and monetary support last month, providing zero interest funding to banks to boost lending growth in the country. The government has also implemented a variety of other initiatives that range from discounted utility bills to waivers of fees to buttress the economy.

Lenders in the UAE have already rolled out a comprehensive package to reduce financial distress of their customers including relief for their SME clients, through reduced costs and fees, loan deferrals and reduced interest rates and processing fees.

Earlier this month the UAE Central Bank also urged lenders to support their private sector clients and individual borrowers to cushion the impact of Covid-19. The CBUAE said banks have so far tapped 60 per cent of a Dh50bn Targeted Economic Support Scheme that was launched in March.","The government of Abu Dhabi is earmarking 15 per cent of procurement spending and annual contracts to micro, small and medium enterprises (mSMEs) from 2020 onwards to spur growth and offset the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

63,abu dhabi commercial bank,28-04-2020,"Emirates Water and Electricity Company received a record-low bid for a planned two gigawatt solar photovoltaic project being developed in the Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi .

The company, a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Power Corporation , said it received a cost-competitive tariff for solar photovoltaic energy of 4.97 fils per kilowatt hour (1.35 US cents/kWh) on the basis of levelised electricity costs .

Ewec did not disclose the name of the lowest bidder.

Acwa Power, EDF in consortium with Jinko Power, International Power-Engie, Marubeni in consortium with Total Solar, and Soft Bank Energy Global alongside Eni submitted technical and commercial bids for the scheme, according to an Ewec representative .

The company will move ahead with negotiating a power purchase agreement with the shortlisted bidder, he said .

The UAE accounts for 4 per cent of global crude output, much of it from oilfields in Abu Dhabi. The emirate is diversifying its energy mix, adding solar and nuclear sources to its grid, as it looks to free up its hydrocarbons for export markets.

Abu Dhabi intends to generate half of its power requirements from clean energy sources by 2030.

The planned two gigawatt PV project comes after the start-up in June of the 1.7 gigawatt Noor Abu Dhabi plant.

That project, built at a cost of Dh3.2 billion, is a joint venture between Abu Dhabi Power Corporation, Japan's Marubeni and China's Jinko Solar.

The tariff received on the Dhafra scheme is 44 per cent lower than the one generated for the Noor Abu Dhabi project, the emirate's first solar PV scheme.

""Securing such competitive tariffs on our energy projects is fundamental to support economic growth across all sectors in the UAE,"" said Ewec chief executive Othman Al Ali.

""We look forward to signing the power purchase agreement and to delivering the project in the second quarter of 2022"".

With the addition of the latest project to the grid, Abu Dhabi's total solar power generation capacity will stand at 3.2 gigawatts .

Ewec tendered financing, construction, operation, and maintenance packages for the Dhafra solar plant in July, for which 24 companies qualified to submit bids.

The company was created in 2019 after a presidential decree and replaced the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Company as part of efforts by the regulator, the Federal Electricity and Water Authority, to consolidate power and water generation assets across the emirate.

The Dhafrah project, which will be built through an independent power producer model, will cover an area of 20 square kilometres and could provide electricity to 110,000 households across the UAE, according to Ewec.

IPPs are typically not owned by the state but build and operate power plants for the sale of electricity to buyers, which could include a utility, the government or end users.","Emirates Water and Electricity Company received a record-low bid for a planned two gigawatt solar photovoltaic project being developed in the Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi .

64,emirates nbd,05-05-2020,"Non-oil economic activity in the GCC’s two biggest economies – Saudi Arabia and the UAE – weakened in April, reflecting the global economic slowdown, as nations across the world continue to enforce lockdowns to stem the spread of the pandemic.

The seasonally-adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index – a composite gauge designed to give a single-figure snapshot of operating conditions in the non-oil private sector economy – improved slightly to 44.4 in April from 42.4 in March, reflecting a slower reduction in new work and stronger contribution from the suppliers' delivery times. A reading above neutral 50 level indicates economic expansion and below points to a contraction.

April data signalled a survey-record decline in Saudi Arabia’s private sector business activity. Lower business volumes were attributed to business closures on the back of government imposed restrictions on movements and shrinking customer demand. There were pockets of growth in business activity, though, on the back of a rise in healthcare spending.

""The small minority of Saudi Arabian companies reporting business activity growth in April often linked this to higher spending on healthcare products and services,” Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said. “There were also sporadic reports that a successful shift to online operations had helped to limit the overall decline in new work, especially among service providers.”

Survey respondents, however, remained cautious about business prospects for the year ahead, with sentiment lifting fractionally from the record-low seen in March, he noted.

New work in Saudi Arabia also decreased sharply in April, with export sales particularly hard hit by international border closures and lockdown measures abroad. The latest fall in new orders from abroad was the fastest since the survey began in August 2009.

Firms in the UAE were also impacted in April by public health measures taken to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Movement restrictions and company closures led to a record fall in activity, as many companies lowered output and adopted working-from-home policies.

The IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 44.1 in April, down from 45.2 in March. April data also showed that measures to stop the virus's spread led to falls in new business and export sales. Input cost, however, fell last month on lower expenses as employment fell and wages were cut.

On the demand side, firms saw a slowdown in client activity, while shop closures and movement restrictions led to a decline in consumer demand. That said, some businesses noted a rise in online sales. Tourism activity, however, declined sharply again last month, as countries worldwide imposed similar restrictions amid the pandemic.

“Although the Mena PMIs remained firmly in contraction territory in April, the GCC PMIs look remarkably stable at first glance,” Khatija Haque – head of Mena research and Daniel Marc Richards, a Mena economist at Emirates NBD, wrote in a note on Tuesday.

The UAE PMI declined just over 1 point from March, while the Saudi PMI actually rose slightly from March. However, the disruption to global supply chains have resulted in PMI readings around the world being “artificially boosted by lengthening supplier delivery times”, they noted.

Purchasing managers' indexes and production gauges in most developed and emerging economies have dropped in the wake of the pandemic, which has tipped the world into the steepest recession since the 1930s Great Depression. Economies around the world are struggling and job losses are on the rise as business activity slows. The number of people applying for unemployment benefits last week climbed to more than 30 million in the US, the world’s biggest economy, despite the country pouring trillions into its economy to offset the impact of the outbreak.

The pandemic has infected more than 3.5 million people and fatalities have risen to over 250,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the outbreak. However, economies in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America, including some states in the US, are beginning a gradual reopening in a bid to revive business and boost employment.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE have also begun easing restrictions as the kingdom lifted a countrywide curfew and the UAE last week allowed for a controlled opening of malls and other businesses.

The pandemic also affected Egypt's non-oil private sector economy in April, with activity, new business and exports declining at record rates. Output was severely limited, leading firms to cut cost and reduce employment. Egypt’s PMI gauge fell significantly to 29.7 in April from 44.2 in March, the lowest figure recorded since the survey began in April 2011.

""The Egypt PMI sunk to an historic low … as the country faced the first full month of measures restricting activity and movement in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses lucky enough to remain open scaled back activity on a massive scale, as many highlighted sharp falls in domestic sales and foreign demand,” David Owen, an economist at IHS Markit, said.

Business expectations, however, remain strong, improving since March, which may suggest firms will look to retain or re-hire workers once the economy reopens, he noted.","April data signalled a survey-record decline in Saudi Arabia’s private sector business activity.

65,emirates nbd,05-05-2020,"Moving country is a hard enough process in itself, but relocating in the middle of a pandemic can present a number of challenges.

From being able to ship your goods on time, to closing down your bank account, telecoms and utility accounts and selling household possessions or your car, there are a number of hurdles to overcome to ensure you leave the country in a timely and proper manner.

Here we guide you through the key relocation steps you need to take to exit the UAE and how to carry out these tasks during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Clear your debts

When you leave the UAE permanently, you must repay and close all outstanding liabilities such as loans and credit cards.

“You don't want to get stopped at the airport and detained for trying to abscond,” says Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of financial comparison website Souqalmal.com. “Even if you do manage to exit, having debt collectors chasing you thousands of miles away isn't exactly ideal.”

Most lenders will demand the full settlement of a loan and the terms and conditions of your personal loan contract may give the bank the right to use your end-of service benefits to settle your liabilities, says Ms Musa.

“It is best to negotiate with the bank to make the debt settlement more affordable for you. Banks may even be willing to lower the settlement amount and waive certain fees in favour of a lump sum settlement,” she adds.

Some customers can also strike a deal to repay debt from overseas, if they can show that rental income from a property is enough to repay a mortgage, or they can prove overseas employment will cover monthly loan instalments, says Ms Musa.

While most negotiations can be handled by telephone during the pandemic, bank branches in the UAE are now reopening so check with your lender where you can handle matters in person.

Emirates NBD, for example, says its customers can settle and close outstanding loans and credit card balances through the bank’s online and mobile banking platforms.

Bank customers must clear their debts before they leave the UAE, says Ambareen Musa of Souqalmal.com. Photo courtesy Souqalmal

Close your bank account

Once your debts are clear, transfer out any remaining balance or savings. This can be done through the bank’s remittance services, an exchange house or an app-based remittance service. Most exchange houses have branches open in the UAE, though some have restricted operating hours.

“Once the funds have been transferred, close your UAE bank accounts to avoid incurring a monthly fee,” says Ms Musa.

However, not all relocating customers need to close their accounts, particularly if they will continue to service debts from overseas or they own property in the UAE and want to collect rental income.

Emirates NBD, for example, says customers can open a non-resident savings account. Fixed deposit accounts can also continue.

To actually close an account, customers must visit their bank branch, return unused chequebooks and debit cards and cancel any direct debits or standing orders.

Emirates NBD says customers should ensure their end of service benefits are paid into the account before it is closed. Account closure takes an average two working days, it adds.

To close the account, you must obtain a no-liability letter from the bank and ensure any postdated cheques are returned to you.

Another tip is to download your credit report form Al Etihad Credit Bureau’s mobile app. “Read it carefully to ensure there's no discrepancy in your bank records,” says Ms Musa.

Disconnect your utilities

Tenants need to request final utility bills from their electricity and AC providers, says Mario Volpi, sales and leasing manager at real estate company Engel & Volkers.

To get your deposit returned from your utility provider, you must disconnect your account and pay the final bill.

Dewa, for example, says its Move out (deactivation of supply) service is still available during the pandemic.

Customers can request these services through Dewa’s website, Smart app, and its customer care centres.

While Dewa’s Customer service centres are open for self-service only, customers can speak to Dewa’s customer happiness team via video link or connect through its smart app and website.

Once the deactivation request is in, the final bill will be ready within 24 working hours, says Dewa, with the deposit amount adjusted and any credit refunded to a bank account either through Western Union or by cheque.

Cancel your phone connection

Your phone connection along with any home services such as TV services or Wi-Fi must also be disconnected. If you had any equipment linked to those packages, such as a TV box, that also needs to returned, says Ms Musa.

According to du, residents leaving the UAE can still cancel phone contracts before their departure, however, due to Covid-19, all of its operations are handled digitally. They need to give du 30 days' notice to close their line.

“We now provide a Live Chat cancellation option in light of the current circumstances … that is available in the self-service section on both our website and the du app”, the company told The National.

Once a cancellation request is in, an agent will confirm the outstanding amount, including out-of-bundle charges, foreclosure fees, and the monthly recurring charge for that month.

The total amount must be paid within three hours, says du, which also advises emailing customer.care@du.ae to double-check your obligations and that lines are closed.

Sell or donate unwanted items

Before you call in a removal company for a shipping quote, clear out unwanted possessions and donate, sell or discard anything non-essential. This will cut your shipping and storage costs, says Bana Shomali, the founder of ServiceMarket, a UAE marketplace for moving and home services.

Covid-19 presents residents with a challenge, however, as renting a table at a flea market or hosting a garage sale are not possible.

However, you can still sell through dubizzle or Facebook community groups. The transaction can be negotiated digitally through dubizzle’s message service or Facebook Messenger and then they buyer and seller can agree on a safe handover. Options include leaving the item outside your home and the buyer leaving the cash in an agreed safe place.

Sell your car

While car buying stopped completely during the 24-hour curfew in Dubai last month, Imad Hammad, the co-founder of second-hand classifieds website CarSwitch.com, says business has picked up since the restrictions were eased.

The company said it had 6,000 new private sellers in February, which dropped by about 30 per cent when movement restrictions tightened last month and ownership transfer offices closed in some emirates, such as Dubai.

“Since restrictions were eased, we’re already seeing many opportunistic buyers come out who are picking up great deals during this tremendous supply / demand gap,” he says.

There is also more appetite for online purchases with several sales closing without physical viewings, he adds, however sellers face a “tough market”.

“There is an oversupply of used cars, with Ramadan offers on new cars, financial / repatriation pressure driving distressed sales, and many dealerships curtailing purchasing until sales pick up,"" he says. ""Prices are collapsing. It may actually get much tougher for sellers in the coming months as the full economic impact of the outbreak becomes evident.""

As well as finding a buyer, remember to pay off your traffic fines, clear your car loan – you cannot transfer your car without doing so – and stop your car insurance payments. If you close a policy early, the insurer will refund the months you don't utilise.

Ship your belongings

To ship your belongings, ask three moving companies for quotations. Note that all packers follow Covid-19 safety measures such as using face masks, hand sanitisers and gloves and the vehicles are sanitised at the end of each day, says Ms Shomali.

Also check what restrictions are in place for the country you are relocating to.

“Some countries are allowing cargo to move but not allowing people to enter, while some ask that you provide medical certificates, official documents and special moving request certificates,” says Ms Shomali.

A November report from Service Market found the average international shipping cost for a two-bedroom apartment ranged from Dh10,000 to relocate your belongings to Egypt to Dh22,000 to the US, but costs have increased during the pandemic.

“According to our partners, prices have been gradually increasing and there is limited availability. Air freight, in particular, is very limited since the number of operating carriers have reduced,"" says Ms Shomali.

“Shipping a full container from the UAE to any destination takes around four to six weeks, but due to a complete lockdown or possible restrictions on working hours or mobility of port and shipping workers in the country you are relocating to, you may face some delays,” she says.

Removal companies are using face masks, hand sanitisers and gloves to pack items, says Bana Shomali, the co-founder of ServiceMarket. Anna Nielsen for The National

Move out of your home

If your tenancy contract is up but you are not exiting the country for a few more weeks or months, you may need to negotiate a longer stay in the property.

“For each day that a tenant overstays (with consent), the landlord can charge,"" says Mr Volpi. ""If the landlord has another tenant moving in straight away, the only option would be to rent again but this time on a short-term basis.""

The number of short-term searches on Property Finder have increased by over 200 per cent since the crisis started, says Lynette Abad, director of research and data at Property Finder. However, she says landlords should be flexible about extending contracts on a monthly basis.

""In Dubai and Abu Dhabi, eviction proceedings have been suspended during the Covid-19 crisis, therefore it is highly recommended that landlords are flexible,"" she adds.

Also, request a move-out permit from the community manager or building management to allow the movers to access your home, something that can be carried out online, says Mario Volpi. Cancelling your Ejari in Dubai and Tawtheeq in Abu Dhabi can also be completed online, he adds.

If you're shipping your belongings but cannot travel yourself due to restrictions, then keep your goods in storage.

“Most international movers provide up to one month of free storage for large shipments,"" adds Ms Shomali.","Here we guide you through the key relocation steps you need to take to exit the UAE and how to carry out these tasks during the Covid-19 pandemic.

66,emirates nbd,03-05-2020,"Markets ended April in good shape, with major indices rallying and optimism growing that movement restrictions will be eased this month as countries enter the next phase of the coronavirus crisis.

Despite economic data demonstrating the devastating effect of lockdowns over the past two months, many investors think their relaxation will give way to recoveries in the second half of the year with the hope the negative fallout will be short-lived, especially if a treatment or vaccine for Covid-19 is found.

Casting a further shadow over the future is the resurrection of the issue that dogged markets throughout last year – the US-China trade dispute Tim Fox

Markets, however, are still overlooking warnings from policymakers that returns to normality could actually take much longer. The European Central Bank’s chief economist Philip Lane says it could take at least three years for the eurozone’s economy to recover to where it was before the crisis. Markets are also overlooking warnings from scientists that a vaccine will take much longer to be found, while companies are becoming more circumspect about the outlook issuing cautionary guidance or even no guidance at all due to the immense challenges they are facing. As such, there are still plenty of reasons to remain wary of the pace and extent of recent equity market recoveries.

Casting a further shadow over the future is the resurrection of the issue that dogged markets throughout last year – the US-China trade dispute – as US President Donald Trump calls for China to be held accountable for the coronavirus pandemic. Somewhat ominously, markets started the first day of this month by dropping sharply following tweets from Mr Trump demanding an investigation into Covid-19’s origins and hinting at retaliation against Beijing. Mr Trump is clearly weighing the political benefits that might accrue from threatening China as the US approaches the presidential election in November, which might outweigh any perceived costs to the economy and even to markets.

It is not certain yet what path Mr Trump will choose to go down, but the mere mention of a return to tariffs and the possible consideration of cancelling debt obligations to China are clearly things that make financial markets very nervous, especially so soon after the trade war ended and in the midst of the worst global recession in decades.

Having signed the first phase of a trade deal in January, which wound down trade tensions between the US and China and brought an end to the introduction of new tariffs, markets were hopeful that phase two talks could begin later this year. This now looks very unlikely, especially with political pressures in Washington starting to build.

Mr Trump’s opinion poll ratings are consistently trailing those of his likely Democrat rival Joe Biden, and in the past 70 years no president with ratings as low as Mr Trump’s (in the mid-40 per cent) at this stage of a campaign have then gone on to win. With time running out in the run up to November, and with the economy unlikely to give him the clear validation he assumed it would prior to coronavirus, populist moves against China seem to be a likelihood in the coming months.

However, with jobs and the economy at risk, playing the China card will not be as straightforward as it was last year. The White House will have to tread very carefully in articulating its case, and more importantly in implementing it. Last week’s volley of accusations blaming China for the pandemic might simply be a case of testing the water, to assess the market reaction and also the effect on Mr Trump’s ratings. Depending on what they show, the Trump Presidency will have to decide how far it can go in terms of reigniting a trade war.

The other dynamic that needs to be taken into account is the progress countering the coronavirus itself. Should the easing of movement restrictions proceed without giving rise to a resumption of Covid-19 cases, then it may be calculated that risks can be taken in the area of trade and tariffs. But if the markets start to become vexed again by prolonged restrictions and easing delays, which is a clear possibility, then the danger of adding another source of tension may become a risk too far.

67,emirates nbd,30-04-2020,"Payments processor Network International is putting a freeze on hiring and halting capital expenditure, as it looks to conserve cash and cut costs amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“We have decided to pause on capital expenditure related to the separation of shared services with Emirates NBD, and to support our entry to the Saudi Arabian market, which were anticipated to be $40 million (Dh146.8m) in total during 2020,” the company said in statement on Thursday.

“Saudi Arabia remains an important future growth accelerator for the business and we are committed to entering this market when more normal circumstances resume.”

Network International said it is also taking “prudent measure to protect” its cashflows. While around two-thirds of the company’s operational expenditure is fixed, it is enforcing a hiring freeze and cutting discretionary spending among other measures, it noted.

The company’s chief executive Simon Haslam will also forgo his annual pay increase on base salary and any annual cash bonus.

“Our chairman and the rest of the board will also reduce their fees by 25 per cent for the remainder of the [current] financial year,” the company said.

Companies across the world are implementing stringent cost cutting measures, including redundancies, unpaid leaves and pay cuts to offset the impact of coronavirus-forced recession. From global banks to oil and gas firms and airlines, major corporations are cutting capital expenditure and shelving expansion plans, as they look to bolster their cash reserves during the crisis.

Network international said it has seen a significant impact from the downturn in consumer spending and its revenues at the end of the first quarter remained “broadly flat”, it said without providing a quarterly revenue figure.

The company said it has a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, following the refinancing of its syndicated debt facility, it said.

“At the end of the Q1 period we have a cash balance of $40m and total available headroom on our revolver [financing facility] and new syndicated debt facility of [about] $270m,” according to the statement.

Network International, which listed in the London Stock Exchange last year, reported a 26 per cent increase in its 2019 net profit on the back of double-digit revenue growth. Its net income from continuing operations climbed to $59m, as revenue grew 12.4 per cent to $334.9m.","Payments processor Network International is putting a freeze on hiring and halting capital expenditure, as it looks to conserve cash and cut costs amid the coronavirus pandemic.

68,emirates nbd,28-04-2020,"ENBD Reit, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust managed by ENBD Asset Management, is to reposition its portfolio by “increasing the diversity of its holdings”.

The Reit, whose recent proposal to delist from Nasdaq Dubai did not secure the required approval from the three-quarters of shareholders, said that in the short-term it will focus on “agile solutions” allowing it to maintain healthy levels of occupancy during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the longer term, it will reposition its portfolio towards “alternative” assets in sectors such as logistics/warehousing and healthcare that offer longer lease agreements and more stable income streams.

“Our priorities this year and next will be to continue to build on diversity in the portfolio – thereby de-risking our position in the context of the market – while taking advantage of lower interest rates to bring down costs,” Anthony Taylor, head of real estate at Emirates NBD Asset Management, said in a statement.

ENBD Reit posted a net loss of $13.3m (Dh61.04m) for the nine months to December 31, 2019 on property income of $26.9m, which was mainly due to a $21m unrealised loss on the value of its portfolio.

ENBD Asset Management proposed a take-private of the Reit in January as its shares continue to trade at a discount of more than 50 per cent of its net asset value, which was $0.98 per share, or $246m at the end of last year.

“Our portfolio came under pressure during 2019 as a result of soft real estate market conditions, and in the short-term these conditions have been exaggerated by the Covid-19 pandemic and a return to low and volatile oil prices. We do, however, remain agile and well-positioned to navigate headwinds and are engaging with tenants across the portfolio with the intention to assist those in genuine financial difficulty,” said Mr Taylor.

“We recognise that a gradual uptick in the real estate market cycle is probably delayed, but we have the diversity and the resilience in our portfolio to maintain occupancy and rental income, with sufficient cashflow to maintain dividend payments to shareholders.”","ENBD Reit, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust managed by ENBD Asset Management, is to reposition its portfolio by “increasing the diversity of its holdings”.

69,emirates nbd,28-04-2020,"I called my bank to find out how I could secure a repayment holiday on my loan during the pandemic. I have been on unpaid leave from my job in the F&B sector since April 1 and last month I only received half of my salary.

I cannot afford to pay the loan instalments, which is why I asked for the grace period.

How can I pay instalments if I was paid half my salary last month and am now on unpaid leave? KS, Abu Dhabi

I was very surprised when the bank rejected my request on the basis that the loan is a card loan. The bank said for this reason it is not eligible for a grace period. I signed up for the loan when the bank offered loans to its credit card holders.

We have never missed a payment until now and our inability to pay is only because of the pandemic, so it’s only fair that we get a grace period.

Surely a loan is a loan, whether it is a personal loan or a card loan? A customer has to pay both back in instalments and the bank's decision seems unfair.

How can I pay instalments if I was paid half my salary last month and am now on unpaid leave?

When I took on the four-year loan in October 2018 the outstanding balance was Dh65,000 with monthly payments of Dh1,970. The outstanding balance is now Dh42,730 and there are 29 more instalments to go. I also have a car loan, which costs Dh2,000 a month.

My monthly expenses come to about Dh10,370 a month and includes Dh4,000 for rent, Dh800 for transport, Dh1,000 for remittances, Dh3,970 for debt repayments and Dh600 for utilities and groceries.

My unpaid leave will continue until further notice, so where can I report this issue to get it resolved? KS, Abu Dhabi

It is true that the standard three-month, penalty-free payment holiday under UAE banks' new financial relief measures is applicable only on retail loans. This means it applies to personal loans, car loans or mortgages and SME business loans. Credit card repayments are not included under this provision.

Loans on credit cards are a credit card-linked facility that works like a preapproved loan, based on your authorised credit limit. Unfortunately, even though it may seem like just another type of personal loan to you, the bank may not treat it the same way.

While repayment relief is available for retail loans across most banks, we are seeing some banks offer their credit card customers the option to postpone their repayments by one month with deferred interest. We're also aware of some banks that have reduced their late payment fees on credit cards. Speak to your bank to figure out if there's any other way they can help ease your repayments on the loan, maybe by restructuring it, extending the repayment tenure or waiving certain penalties.

You also mention having a car loan on top of this. Therefore, you can get access to a three-month repayment holiday on that to ease some of your financial burden. At the same time, it is also important that you look into your own budget to see how you can cut back and consolidate your savings. If you managed to set up some emergency savings earlier, you may need to tap into this fund to keep up with your household expenses and debt obligations.

It may also be a good idea to look for part-time or temporary work opportunities to stay afloat during this crisis. Speak to your employer to see if you can offer your services in a different function within the company, or reach out to companies that are seeing consistent demand during this time. They may be able to offer you a temporary assignment based on your skills and experience.

Debt panellist 2: R Sivaram, executive vice president, head of retail banking products, Emirates NBD

This can be a challenging time financially but there are viable solutions that you can explore.

As a first step, request a conversation with the concerned department in the bank to get a clear understanding on why your payment deferment request was denied. While there could be multiple reasons for rejection such as system limitations or product and policy restrictions, it is useful to discuss this with the bank and explore alternate solutions that could help address your request.

One potential option would be to convert your existing loan on the credit card into a personal loan. If you pursue this route, I would advise rescheduling your personal loan for a tenor of four years which would lower your future equal monthly instalments (EMIs) and allow for a 90-day first payment deferral which is typically a standard feature in personal loans.

I would also advise you to cancel your credit card to better manage your finances, and to explore deferring your existing auto loan. You may find it easier to secure a car loan deferral and it will provide immediate relief to your cash flow.

Having a job in hand is definitely a positive, even if you are on unpaid leave. Given you are being forthcoming about managing your financial commitments with a good and regular repayment history, I am sure your bank will view your current situation favourably and find a suitable solution that could help address your predicament.

This pandemic is hitting some people's finances very hard. What's super important is to revisit your own expenses to help you get through this period until your income starts again. This is crucial for anyone who has been affected financially by the crisis and is also a good exercise for those in better financial situations.

Firstly, identify which expenses are essential. Then look at what costs you can get rid of for now. The restrictive measures we have all been observing means you won't be spending in the same way you used to. Ask yourself, 'what do I no longer need or what can do without for now?' This can include expenses such as petrol, Salik, entertainment, sports and dining out. Really limit yourself and see this as a temporary situation.

Now identify the bigger expenses you can also trim, such as rent or school fees. Contact your landlord and see what flexibility they can offer you at this time. Many landlords will help tenants facing financial difficulty – you just have to ask. Could you negotiate a payment holiday until you get back on your feet? The same may apply for school fees as some schools are also being flexible and trying to help parents meet their obligations.

Crises like this really highlight the importance of having an emergency fund. Ideally, everyone should have three months of expenses set aside for emergencies, and for extreme scenarios such as this one the goal is to have six months of expenses.

As well as keeping your expenses to the minimum, do your best to negotiate with the bank and perhaps take a repayment on the car loan instead of the card loan. This will help you get through this period until you start earning again. Once your income returns, remember to build up your emergency fund to get you through the next crisis.

70,emirates nbd,21-04-2020,"West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, rebounded in trading on Tuesday but slipped back into negative territory after plunging to historic lows the previous day.

Brent, the international crude benchmark, fell to its lowest since 2002.

The May contract for WTI, which tracks North American crude grades, was in the single digits during early trading on Tuesday, but then fell to -$5.20 per barrel, up 86.18 per cent at 4.39pm UAE time after sinking to -$37.61 for the first time on Monday.

The plummet in price is largely due to storage capacity constraints and ebbing demand as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Brent fell 19.05 per cent to $20.70 per barrel.

WTI’s June futures contract also continued to fall and was trading at $15.70 per barrel.

The US oil benchmark tumbled to as little as -$40 briefly on Monday before settling at -$37.63. It closed at $18.27 on Friday.

WTI’s spectacular collapse comes as the US is faced with a shortage of storage for crude, where a record supply from the shale boom has not been matched with adequate storage or pipeline infrastructure.

""Some may dismiss Monday’s fall into negative WTI prices as a quirk of the futures market on the last day before a contract ended,"" said Jim Burkhard, vice president and head of oil markets at IHS Markit.

""But the fact that prices went this low at all reflects brutal market forces that will not disappear with the expiration of a single monthly contract,"" he added.

The lowest oil prices had fallen previously was in 1931, when value plunged to $0.1 per barrel. Oil's crash on Monday is also blamed on small-time exchange-traded funds (ETFs), whose routine monthly roll-over was complicated by the fact that there were no takers for oil without booked storage at WTI's physical delivery point in Cushing, Oklahoma.

The demand crunch caused by the coronavirus pandemic has hastened the collapse in consumption as airlines stay grounded and people work from home, limiting the demand for crude products. Oil demand is set to contract by 29 million barrels per day in April, according to the International Energy Agency - the lowest since 1995.

Oil markets are “distorted” not broken as demand has fallen off the charts, Emirates NBD said in a note on Tuesday.

“While the descent of spot prices into negative territory is unprecedented in futures markets, the enormously wide contango in the WTI and Brent market structures gives another strong indicator of how distorted markets have become,” said Edward Bell, a commodity analyst at the Dubai-based bank.

Contango refers to a situation when spot prices for a commodity are lower than forward pricing.

Storage is near the brim, filling up more than 77 per cent of available total capacity. US crude is also constrained by the landlocked nature of production across its basins and limited offtake through pipelines, which constrains its ability to use floating storage as an option, unlike other producers.

The blow to the US oil industry comes after the country, which is the top global producer for oil and gas, agreed to join forces with Opec+ and the G20 exporters to cut production to stabilise the markets. The new alliance, which includes the US and G20 countries, is referred to as Opec++.

While US commitments remained unclear, the alliance touted a 20m bpd drawback from the markets starting in May. Opec+ alone is expected to cut 9.7m bpd in May and June, with tapered cuts in place until 2022.

But Gulf producers including Saudi Arabia and the UAE are bringing record production to the markets this month to honour commitments from before the historic pact.

On Tuesday Saudi Arabia's cabinet held discussions and reiterated the kingdom's ""keenness to achieve stability in the oil market,"" according to a statement carried by the state-run SPA. The kingdom reiterated that it and Russia have a ""firm commitment to implement agreed targeted cuts over the next two years ... and [are] prepared to take further measures jointly with Opec+ and other producers.""

Sara Vakhshouri of SVB Energy said the negative market reaction to US crude was not indicative of the alliance’s efforts to balance the markets.

“This doesn’t reflect the Opec++ cuts, which are effective from May 1. Prices for June delivery are higher than May delivery,” she said.

“Also, the huge US oil price collapse [against others] is related to the quality of this oil, which is light and mostly yields jet fuel, gasoline, and diesel.”

Demand for these refined petroleum products has been hit the hardest by mobility restrictions in place to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.","The lowest oil prices had fallen previously was in 1931, when value plunged to $0.1 per barrel.

71,emirates nbd,20-04-2020,"During the Covid-19 crisis in the UAE, certain needs such as buying groceries and medicine are considered essential.

But what about sending money home? With its majority expatriate population, the UAE is one of the highest outward remittance countries in the world. Many migrant workers have families in their home countries who depend on them for financial support.

Exchange houses and banks are still allowed to open, but some are closed or only operating reduced hours. Money transfer companies in the Emirates have seen a sharp rise in the use of digital channels as residents are told to stay home to prevent the spread of the virus. Yet, that is not an option for the “unbanked”, who don’t have a bank account, credit card or debit card.

As well as the restrictions, convenience, cost and speed are other factors to consider. Here we guide you through the options to remit money from the UAE, as the worldwide coronavirus outbreak and precautionary measures continue.

The UAE is one of the largest outbound remittance countries in the world with the vast majority of personal remittances sent through exchange houses. Victor Besa / The National

Exchange houses are considered a support service

The vast majority of personal remittances are sent through exchange houses. Of the Dh165.2 billion sent from the Emirates last year, Dh131.2bn was remitted through exchange houses and Dh34bn through banks, according to the Central Bank’s 2019 annual report.

The Covid-19 crisis has changed the world as we know it, with more than 2.4 million confirmed cases across the globe and over 165,000 deaths as of Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Most countries around the world, including the UAE, continue to enforce physical distancing and movement restrictions, including business closures, travel bans and stay-home directives.

In Dubai, residents can apply for a movement permit every three days to buy essentials or an emergency, and every five days for ATM cash withdrawal. A DXB move permit call centre representative (800-737648) said applicants should choose “emergency” if they need to send money home and explain the reason under the description.

Rashed Al Ansari, chief executive of Al Ansari Exchange, says exchange houses have been designated by the Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management as a “support service” because “we play an instrumental role in paying wages to a large segment of the workforce here in the UAE through the Wage Protection System (WPS) and also provide remittance services for them”.

The mandatory Wage Protection System, developed by the central bank, requires every private sector employer to choose a registered agent, such as banks, exchange houses and financial institutions, to record wage payments, ensuring they are paid on time at the agreed rate.

Some exchange houses are closed, while others operate shorter hours

Shopping malls and non-essential businesses have closed in the Emirates, following government directives. At first, it was understood that mall branches of banks and exchange houses would be included in the closures. However, Osama Al Rahma, chief executive of Al Fardan Exchange, says the decision depends on a mall's management, business flow and specific government restrictions.

In Abu Dhabi, for example, Al Fardan branches in Al Wahda Mall and Marina Mall have closed, Mr Al Rahma says, while other locations are shut due to the nationwide disinfection drive, such as the Gold Souk branch in Dubai.

Osama Al Rahma, chief executive of Al Fardan Exchange and FERG Vice Chairman, says most exchange house branches remain open. Leslie Pableo / The National

Al Ansari, which has more than 190 branches across the UAE, has only closed a few branches. These include Dubai Outlet Mall, Dubai Mall and Dragon Mart as well as Souq Murshid and Naif in Deira. In Abu Dhabi, Marina Mall and Yas Mall branches are closed, while in Sharjah, Sahara Centre is closed.

Orient Exchange has closed a handful of locations out of its 25 branches in the UAE, says its chief executive Rajiv Raipancholia.

Banks have closed a higher proportion of branches, as most transactions can be carried out online or through ATMs. Emirates NBD, for example, is only operating 17 “strategically located branches nationwide with limited services” from April 11, according to its website. First Abu Dhabi Bank, meanwhile, has temporarily closed 50 of its branches and kept 25 open.

In Dubai, exchange houses are only allowed to operate between the hours of 8am and 2pm. In the rest of the UAE, they are allowed to operate for longer. It is advisable to call ahead to check the latest updates, as the situation is fluid.

Banks also have reduced branch timings, most choosing to operate from 8am or 9am until 12pm or 1pm.

There are plenty of online alternatives

In recent years, exchange houses and banks have ramped up their digital offerings amid rising competition to make transfers more convenient, cheaper and faster. This helps those who do not want to leave the house during Covid-19 to make transfers.

Last week, global low-cost digital money transfer service TransferWise started operating in the UAE, six months after receiving its licence from Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The platform lets users send money online at the mid-market exchange rate – the midpoint between demand and supply for a currency – and charges an upfront, transparent fee.

TransferWise says a quarter of its transactions globally are completed in less than 20 seconds. The service has the added benefit that it is fully online without the need to verify identity in person.

Banks also offer customers digital transfer options, such as Mashreq Bank’s Quick Remit and Emirates NBD’s DirectRemit.

Last month, FAB partnered with MasterCard to offer the payit mobile wallet, which delivers instant remittances to select bank accounts and wallets internationally. There are no fees, while exchange rates are “well benchmarked to the market”, a FAB spokesperson said.

“Bringing this technology to the market as early as possible is crucial now more than ever,” said Hana Al Rostamani, group head of personal banking at FAB.

ToTok, an instant messaging app used by more than 20 million people worldwide, launched ToTok Pay for android smartphone owners in the UAE on March 23, with users able to send money to friends and family through ToTok chat.

ToTok co-founder Giacomo Ziani hopes the company's contactless and cashless payment method will ""play a small part in helping protect public health"" in the UAE at this time.

Western Union, which rolled out its digital money transfer services in the UAE last year, allows customers to make online transfers using debit, credit and pre-paid cards, as well as bank accounts, in its global network of 100 countries.

Adeem Ahamed, managing director of Lulu International Exchange, says Lulu Money has seen its transactions rise 35 per cent relative to January. Photo courtesy Lulu Exchange

Many exchange houses say their money transfer apps have seen a huge sharp rise in demand amid the outbreak. Lulu Money is clocking over 5,000 downloads daily with overall transactions rising 35 per cent relative to January. The company has also handled 6,000 chats per week, a spike of 450 per cent from its earlier average of 5,000 per month.

“The adoption rate to digital has accelerated in recent weeks, as people slowly realise the medium’s inherent advantages,” says Adeeb Ahamed, managing director of Lulu International Exchange. “We have noticed customers switch over to our secure mobile app, Lulu Money, at an exponential rate.”

While 90 per cent of Lulu Money's transactions are processed in under 15 seconds, the rest take less than a minute, he says. However, the app can only be used by existing customers who have completed the KYC (Know Your Customer) process in physical branches. New customers must visit branches to verify their identity.

Rashed Al Ansari, chief executive of Al Ansari Exchange, says the money transfer operator's digital app has seen a transaction increase of more than 40 per cent in March. Photo courtesy Al Ansari

Al Ansari recorded over 110,000 online transactions in March, an increase of more than 40 per cent. However, transactions made through the mobile app only represent 7 per cent of Al Ansari’s total remittances.

“Despite the surge in mobile app remittance, a large segment of the population still prefers visiting brick-and-mortar branches,” says Mr Al Ansari.

Again, new customers have to initially visit the branch to verify their identity and, more importantly, digital options are not available to the “unbanked” population.

Mr Al Ansari says the exchange house is in the final stages of developing a feature in its mobile app that enables customers to remit money from their WPS card directly without visiting a branch and without the need for a “full-fledged bank account”.

FinTech start-ups, such as Now Money, Rise and Denarii Cash, offer low-cost options to those who don't have a bank account or access to other money transfer methods.

Comparing the cost will become key

Several variables affect the cost of money transfers, such as the method used, destination and amount to be remitted.

“It’s also important for customers to recognise that although the headline exchange rate can seem attractive, when fees are added the overall cost can increase significantly and this should be taken into consideration when comparing costs,” says Graham Flannery, chief executive of Wall Street Exchange.

The World Bank publishes cost comparisons on its website, covering 12 corridors from the UAE, including top receivers India, Pakistan and the Philippines. It also includes the speed of the transfer, which can vary from less than a minute to a couple of days.

With the coronavirus crisis, people have become more savvy when it comes to exploring their options.

“Before Covid-19 and after Covid-19, I think we will find a major change in consumer behaviours,” says Mr Al Rahma, who is also vice chairman of the Foreign Exchange and Remittance Group (FERG), representing more than 70 exchange houses in the UAE. “People used to be hesitant to use apps … this will totally change the mindset.”","Here we guide you through the options to remit money from the UAE, as the worldwide coronavirus outbreak and precautionary measures continue.

72,emirates nbd,20-04-2020,"Emirates NBD, the biggest lender by assets in Dubai, reported a 24 per cent year-on-year decline in its first quarter net income as it increased provisions for potential bad loans amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Net profit for three months to the end of March declined to Dh2.1 billion, the lender said in a statement to the Dubai Financial Market, where its shares trade.

While credit quality was stable in the first quarter of the year, Emirates NBD increased impairment allowances in recognition of a “potential deterioration” in credit quality in subsequent quarters related to the coronavirus pandemic, it said.

Total impairment charges for the reporting period increased more than three-fold to Dh2.56bn at the end of March 2019. Operating profit before impairments came in 46 per cent higher at Dh4.84bn, but fell 17 per cent year-on-year to Dh2.28bn after the charge for potential bad loans.

“The operating performance for the first quarter of 2020 was good, prior to the emergence of the economic impact of Covid-19 in March 2020,” Patrick Sullivan, group chief financial officer, said.

Regional banks are “facing multiple challenges” from low interest rates, low oil prices and lower economic growth due to disruption from the pandemic, he said.

“Emirates NBD has a good underlying operating performance, coupled with a robust balance sheet to help navigate these challenges. The group continues to operate with strong liquidity and healthy capital ratios.”

Lenders worldwide are facing a decline in profitability as loan growth slows and interest rates plunge due to the pandemic's disruption of the global economy. Last week, JPMorgan Chase, America's largest bank, reported a 69 per cent drop in first quarter profit, as it set aside $8.3bn for loan-loss provisions.

The global economy has slumped into the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The International Monetary Fund last week projected a 3 per cent contraction in global output for 2020 and said the outlook for the world economy is worse than the 2008 global economic crisis.

The UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, was the first in the Middle East and North Africa to roll out Dh282bn in fiscal and monetary support, providing zero interest funding to banks to boost lending growth in the country. In addition, the government implemented a variety of other initiatives that range from discounted utility bills to waivers of fees to buttress the economy.

Emirates NBD on Monday said its total income climbed 46 per cent to Dh6.88bn due to loan growth and higher fee income including its Turkish unit DenizBank. Net interest margin improved 19 basis points to 3.02 per cent, helped by the positive impact of DenizBank.

DenizBank, which is the fifth-largest private bank in Turkey, contributed total income of Dh2.25bn and net profit of Dh504m to the Group for the first three months of 2020.

Emirates NBD’s total assets at the end of the first quarter climbed to Dh691.7bn, up 1 per cent from the end of 2019, while loans also climbed by 1 per cent to Dh443bn for the period. Customer deposits remained steady at Dh467bn.

The bank’s non-performing loans ratio was stable at 5.5 per cent and its coverage ratio improved by 8.2 per cent to 120.5 per cent, the bank said. Common equity tier 1 ratio at 14.8 per cent was well above minimum regulatory requirements, it added.

Emirates NBD is among UAE banks that have rolled out support measures to help reduce financial stress for their clients.

Banks have extended relief to businesses and individuals, particularly in stressed sectors, through reduced costs and fees, loan deferrals, reduced interest rates and lower processing fees.

Earlier this week, the UAE Central Bank urged lenders to help individual borrowers as well as small and medium-sized enterprises to blunt the impact of the pandemic on the country’s economy. UAE lenders have so far tapped 30 per cent of a Dh50bn Targeted Economic Support Scheme facility and ""are passing on these funds to their customers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic"", governor Abdulhamid Saeed said on Sunday.","Emirates NBD, the biggest lender by assets in Dubai, reported a 24 per cent year-on-year decline in its first quarter net income as it increased provisions for potential bad loans amid the coronavirus pandemic.

73,emirates nbd,20-04-2020,"The US oil price turned negative on Monday for the first time in history on concerns of an increase in supply to the market, a saturation of storage capacity and subdued demand due to the coronavirus pandemic that has brought the world economy to a halt.

The May West Texas Intermediate contract, the benchmark for US oil, fell $19.06, or 104.3 per cent, to a discount of 79 cents per barrel at just after 10pm UAE time after touching an all-time low of -$1.43 per barrel.

In such a situation, producers are expected to pay potential buyers to take their output.

The Brent crude benchmark was down $1.85, or 6.6 per cent, at $26.23 per barrel. The June WTI contract is trading more actively at a much higher level of $21.6 per barrel. The spread between May and June was more than $23, the widest in history for the two nearest monthly contracts.

Investors bailed out of the May contract ahead of expiry later on Monday because of lack of demand for the actual oil, Reuters said. When a futures contract expires, traders must decide whether to take delivery of the oil or roll their positions into another futures contract for a later month.

BREAKING: WTI crude oil futures trade at negative price for first time https://t.co/pOSyH6AVtP pic.twitter.com/XsoH1jG8WH — Bloomberg (@business) April 20, 2020

Futures in New York for May collapsed in spite of a global pact to draw down as much as 20 million barrels per day from the markets.

In response to the oil price collapse, after the market close, US President Donald Trump said his administration was reviewing the possibility of stopping incoming Saudi Arabian crude oil shipments as a measure to support the battered domestic drilling industry.

Mr Trump reiterated his promise on Monday that the United States will purchase as much as 75 million barrels of oil and put it into the strategic reserve for the first time in decades.

""That would be the first time in a long time that it has been topped out. We get it for the right price,"" Mr Trump said.

Later in the press conference, Mr Trump said he would only buy that amount if Congress authorised the funding, or if the federal government could rent storage space to third parties for a fee.

However, the Opec+ agreement, which relies on involuntary cuts for half the drawdown is expected to kick in from May.

Against this backdrop, crude is running out of storage facilities with global capacity expected to reach saturation as soon as May, according to estimations by various energy agencies, due excess supply and low demand.

Opec+ is set to enforce 9.7m bpd of cuts from May, however, the producers led by Saudi Arabia are bringing record levels of output to the market in April.

Opec+ appeared open to suggestions for more than agreed to share of cuts should the price rout continue. The alliance was monitoring the oil markets closely and was prepared to take ""further measures jointly with Opec+ and other producers, if deemed necessary"" Riyadh and Moscow said in a joint statement over the weekend.

""If the Opec+ deal carries on last previous iterations we would expect to see voluntary Saudi over-compliance, i.e., cutting more than its share of the deal provided that other producers make an effort to cut output as well,"" said Aditya Pugalia, director, financial markets research at Emirates NBD.

Global oil storage capacity is close to the brim and the US energy department is reportedly considering paying producers to keep their oil reserves untapped. The department of energy stepped up buying of crude when prices bottomed however domestic and global capacities are close to full.

US crude stocks at refineries and tank farms, which averaged 375m barrels at the end of last week have filled up 57 per cent of available capacity, according to the Energy Information Authority.

Oil storage tanks operated by Transneft near Moscow, Russia. Market oversupply could add a further 1.3 billion barrels to global oil stocks, according to Opec. Bloomberg

Demand is well behind and storage could already be at 70-80 per cent capacity, according to the London Capital Group.

""In extreme pockets of the market, there could already be no storage and even negative oil prices,"" said Jasper Lawler, head of research at LCG.

Markets were in a state of 'super contango' where spot prices for US crude were lower than the forward price, ahead of the expiry of the May contract on Tuesday.","The US oil price turned negative on Monday for the first time in history on concerns of an increase in supply to the market, a saturation of storage capacity and subdued demand due to the coronavirus pandemic that has brought the world economy to a halt.

74,emirates nbd,19-04-2020,"UAE lenders have tapped 30 per cent of a Dh50 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess) facility to help businesses and individuals through the Covid-19 outbreak, the Central Bank of the UAE said on Sunday.

Lenders ""are passing on these funds to their customers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic"", Governor Abdulhamid Saeed said.

""We will continue to work closely with banks and financial institutions to accelerate their full utilisation of the Tess,"" Mr Saeed said.

""This requires banks to closely collaborate with us and intensify their efforts to implement the economic stimulus package for the benefit of the banking sector and the UAE economy.”

The support scheme was announced as a Dh100 billion package on March 14, which included a direct Dh50bn injection of funds through zero cost collateralised loans provided by the central bank, plus a relaxation of banks' capital buffers allowing them to increase lending by another Dh50bn.

Further easing of restrictions on capital and liquidity reserves subsequently increased the overall size of the stimulus to Dh256bn.

The central bank also reiterated that lenders remove requirements for small and medium-sized businesses to have a minimum account balance of Dh10,000 before opening accounts.

The regulator also said lenders should speed up the length of time it took to open accounts to no longer than two days – unless potential customers were deemed to be high-risk under anti money-laundering rules.

The central bank said it expected banks to ""retain sound lending standards"" and treat customers fairly, but added that all banks should participate in the scheme, which is set to run until the end of this year. It also said it will begin to publish details of how individual banks have used the Tess facility, starting next month.

The Covid-19 outbreak represents the biggest challenge to the global economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s, as social distancing measures put in to limit its spread hit industries such as aviation and tourism hard.

Last week, the International Monetary Fund said it expected the global economy to shrink 3 per cent in 2020, a sharp downward revision from its earlier forecast of 3.3 per cent growth. Lower oil prices also mean Middle East and Central Asia economies were projected to contract 2.8 per cent this year.

Banks in Abu Dhabi were undertaking 17 initiatives to help customers affected by Covid-19, such as payment holidays for up to three months on mortgages, personal loans and credit card debts for individuals, and three-month holidays on business loans (with no extra charges) for SMEs.

A group of lenders in Dubai, including Emirates NBD and Dubai Islamic Bank, have begun similar measures.","UAE lenders have tapped 30 per cent of a Dh50 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess) facility to help businesses and individuals through the Covid-19 outbreak, the Central Bank of the UAE said on Sunday.

75,emirates nbd,19-04-2020,"The International Monetary Fund slashed its global growth projections for 2020 in its latest World Economic Outlook, with global gross domestic product expected to contract by 3 per cent this year, the worst annual performance since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

The fund anticipates a contraction of 6.1 per cent in developed markets and 1 per cent in emerging markets, unlike the 2008-09 financial crisis when emerging markets still managed to record some growth.

As jarring as this might seem when so many jobs are being lost, markets are seeing light at the end of the tunnel … Tim Fox, Emirates NBD

Among major economies the IMF expects the US to contract by 5.9 per cent, the eurozone by more than 7 per cent and the UK by 6.5 per cent, while negligible growth in China and India (1.2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively) means they are the only nations keeping the global recession from getting even worse.

For the GCC, the IMF unsurprisingly downgraded growth forecasts for 2020 across the region as well. The Fund now expects the UAE economy to contract by 3.5 per cent this year, while Saudi Arabia is forecast to shrink 2.3 per cent.

Budget deficits are also all projected to widen sharply this year, with Oman and Bahrain likely to be the largest in the GCC, widening by 16.5 per cent of GDP and 15.7 per cent of GDP respectively. The IMF is forecasting a budget shortfall of 12.5 per cent in Saudi Arabia and 11.1 per cent in the UAE this year. However, growth is expected to rebound in 2021 with the UAE expected to grow by 3.3 per cent and Saudi Arabia by almost 3 per cent.

The IMF described the challenges that EM economies are facing currently as a ""perfect storm"", in that they have experienced the sharpest reversal in portfolio flows on record, of about $100 billion (Dh367.3bn), putting pressure on the more leveraged and less creditworthy borrowers.

Last week certainly felt like a perfect storm in terms of the sharp deterioration in economic activity that was catalogued. US economic indicators such as industrial production, housing, business surveys and retail sales all revealed monthly declines that are at, or near, record lows. US initial jobless claims over the past four weeks reached 22 million, or nearly 15 per cent of the US workforce, effectively wiping out all the US employment gains since the end of the last US recession in December 2009.

Chinese data also showed real GDP declining 6.8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, the biggest contraction since the country began reporting official figures in 1992. The concern of course is that in most of the world the first quarter is unlikely to be the worst period of this crisis, with the second quarter expected to reveal much bigger contractions elsewhere. Warnings were heard last week that UK GDP could fall by as much as 35 per cent in this quarter, while US growth estimates are equally apocalyptic.

However, parallel to all of the bad news, there have also been glimmers of hope. For one thing markets are taking a more optimistic view of the situation, with the S&P 500 index having recovered 55 per cent of its first quarter collapse. As jarring as this might seem when so many jobs are being lost, markets are seeing light at the end of the tunnel with reduced numbers of coronavirus cases in some of the worst affected countries, and moderating mortality rates in others.

Markets are also encouraged that fast action by global policymakers has staved off what could have been a much worse economic crisis and set the grounds for an eventual recovery, so much so that the narrative is increasingly turning to when can economies re-open, with some European countries already starting to.

Across the world, policy responses have been exceptional, both in terms of their sizes and their speed. It may well be that markets are merely thriving on the injection of unprecedented amounts of liquidity into the financial system, and are fearful of fighting the US Federal Reserve, but it can also be seen that stimulus steps are finding their way to end users, with household relief cheques starting to be received across the US and other relief programmes getting tapped out.

Outside the US, the experience is perhaps more mixed, with much still needing to be done, but at least it cannot be said that governments and central banks have held back. If in the end it still proves too little to counter the perfect storm this will probably be a function of the unique enormity of this crisis, not the temerity of the response.

76,emirates nbd,15-04-2020,"TransferWise, a global low-cost digital money transfer service, is now operating in the UAE, six months after receiving its license from Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the company said on Tuesday.

“Now the big day has come and we’re actually launching,” Kristo Kaarmann, chief executive and co-founder of TransferWise told The National. “The UAE is one of the most important remittance markets in the world, and we’re delighted to be bringing the first fully online money transfers to the country”.

A total of Dh169.2 billion was sent from the UAE in 2018 out of total global remittances of $689bn (Dh2.5 trillion), according to Central Bank and World Bank figures, respectively. The Emirates and Saudi Arabia were the second and third top remittance countries after the US in 2017.

TransferWise, which was founded in the UK in 2011, has 14 global offices, 7 million customers worldwide and processes $5bn in customer payments every month. The platform enables people to send money online at the mid-market exchange rate – the midpoint between demand and supply for a currency – and charges an upfront, transparent fee.

The company’s goal is to make sending money abroad more convenient, cheaper and faster. After TransferWise received its ADGM license in October, 15,000 customers signed up to be notified about the availability of currency routes from the UAE.

“That just gives you a hint of the demand,” Mr Kaarmann said. In a beta trial with 3,000 customers, popular transfer destinations included the UK, the eurozone, the US, followed by Asian countries.

“People can now send money to over 80 countries without leaving their homes, and all at the real, mid-market exchange rate,” he said.

The company offers over 1,600 currency routes and 49 currencies. Customers in the UAE with a bank account can verify their identification and register for TransferWise online.

Globally, TransferWise claims to save users $1bn a year compared to making the same transaction with a bank. In the Emirates, the company cites research carried out by UAE-based Viva Consulting that found the cost of sending money abroad was “up to two times cheaper” with TransferWise compared to six banks and brokers.

The study compared the cost of sending remittances from the UAE between March 1 and 5 with Al Ansari Exchange, Al Fardan Exchange, Western Union, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), HSBC and Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB). The data points were for transfers from dirhams to US dollars, euros and British pounds, including upfront fees and exchange rate markups.

Al Ansari, Western Union and HSBC declined to comment. ADCB and DIB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Osama Al Rahma, chief executive of Al Fardan, said the claim does not reflect “the facts and figures on the ground”. The “UAE is considered one of the cheapest in charges worldwide,” Mr Al Rahma said.

The global average cost to send $200 in the first quarter of this year was 6.79 per cent, according to the World Bank’s March 2020 Remittance Prices Worldwide report.

The cost of sending money from the UAE varies by destination and method. The World Bank publishes cost comparisons on its website, covering 12 corridors from the UAE, including top receivers India, Pakistan and the Philippines.

For example, from the UAE to India, the average cost to send Dh735 ($200) was 3.04 per cent as of February. The cheapest was Emirates NBD Direct Remit, which is only available to bank customers, but has no fee and an exchange rate margin of 0.82 per cent. Traditional money exchange operators, including Western Union, Al Ansari and Al Fardan, charged between Dh20 and Dh24, which is around 3 per cent. Noor Bank was the most expensive, charging over 9 per cent.

Sending Dh735 to India through TransferWise on Tuesday would have cost Dh12.63 in fees, which is 1.71 per cent.

TransferWise said the speed of transfers is another factor that sets it apart. “Globally we’re able to deliver 25 per cent of our payments in 20 seconds,” Mr Kaarmann said.

Abu Dhabi will serve as the company’s hub for expansion elsewhere in the Middle East, although Mr Kaarmann said it is “too soon for us to comment” on where they will go next.

Tim Harley, head of Middle East expansion for TransferWise, said the firm looks at the size of the opportunity, product differentiation and the maturity of the regulatory landscape. He pointed to the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, which in February released additional licensing guidelines for digital-only banks in the kingdom.

“These are great signs to us and that shows us that regulators are looking to each other in the region, as well as to other regions,” Mr Harley said.

Mr Kaarmann said TransferWise is “excited to be working with [ADGM] as a local partner”, bringing “innovation on the ground to the UAE”. In July last year, ADGM’s FSRA published regulatory frameworks for the establishment of digital banks and robo-advisers.

“We are pleased to welcome TransferWise to our portfolio of financial services entities,” said Steve Barnett, executive director of business development at ADGM, in a statement. “ADGM is committed to leveraging Abu Dhabi’s robust business environment to attract the world’s foremost enterprises, in an effort to facilitate further growth and development in the UAE and across the region.”

Tim Harley, head of Middle East expansion at TransferWise, said there are positive signs that the region's regulatory environment is maturing. Victor Besa / The National

On a global level, TransferWise expanded to Malaysia at the end of last year and partnered with China's Alipay last month. In total it has raised $689 million in primary and secondary funding from investors, including private equity firm Index Ventures, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson.

The company, which was valued at $3.5bn last year after BlackRock and other investment funds acquired a $292m stake in it, stopped fundraising as it became profitable, with £179m (Dh828m) in revenue and £10.3m in net profits in the fiscal year ending March 2019.

“We’re now raising every month a ton of money from our customers in the transparent fees that we charge, so that we can launch in new countries, we can improve the service, we can get faster … basically invest in a better product,” Mr Kaarmann said.

As for the prospect of going public, he said: “That possibility is there. We haven’t moved on that and don’t have immediate plans to move on that.”

“We always try to think of ‘does it matter for our customers?’ It doesn’t really,” Mr Kaarmann said. “I think our customers don’t really care if our shares are publicly traded or privately traded.”

TransferWise conducts secondary sales to bring on new shareholders and provide liquidity for earlier stage shareholders.

For now, a major focus is satisfying demand in the UAE before moving on the next plans. “We’re just getting going here, so we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves too much,” Mr Kaarmann said.","Customers in the UAE with a bank account can verify their identification and register for TransferWise online.

I have a personal loan that I repay every month and also have monthly payments to a cleaning agency and a quarterly cheque to my landlord that are due during the transition period between the two jobs.

I am financially ready for the bank to freeze my gratuity until I provide them with the new paperwork, but I need to ensure I don't face issues with the cheques AG, Dubai

What will happen to these cheques when they are paid in by the bearer? If I keep sufficient funds in my account, will my bank freeze that amount too as well as the gratuity payment?

My debts are: outstanding balance / monthly payment

Personal loan: Dh120,000 (Dh6,133)

Car loan: Dh110,000 (Dh2,273)

Credit card: Dh10,000 (I have two personal payment plans on the card – Dh550 until September 2020 and Dh650 until March 2021)

Total: Dh240,000 (Dh9,606)

I borrowed the money to consolidate previous liabilities and to pay back relatives for some money I borrowed to cover some medical bills.

The last date with my current employer will be April 21 and I will start my new role on May 4. I am financially ready for the bank to freeze my gratuity until I provide them with the new paperwork, but I need to ensure I don't face issues with the cheques.

I earn Dh33,000 a month and expect my end-of-service payment to be around Dh25,000 (Dh15,000 for the gratuity and Dh10,000 in leave I have not taken). Could I ask my current employer to pay my last salary and the gratuity separately? I could then withdraw my salary to avoid the freeze on my salary. I can cover the cheques without using the gratuity as long as the bank does not freeze my entire account.

My monthly expenses come to about Dh21,000 and include Dh8,300 for rent, Dh2,500 for a live-in nanny from an agency, Dh1,500 for utilities, Dh3,500 for groceries, Dh4,000 for general expenses and Dh1,200 for car expenses. In addition, I also pay around Dh10,000 per year for my kids’ education as my employer covers up to Dh60,000 per year.

Debt panellist 1: R Sivaram, executive vice president, head of retail banking products, Emirates NBD

You are right about the action taken by banks when they receive end-of-service benefits for customers with an outstanding loan. Often as a precautionary measure, UAE banks place a lien on such customers’ bank accounts because banking guidelines mandate lending only to individuals with a valid employment visa and earning a minimum salary. As such, banks need to confirm these conditions will continue to be met when the customer resigns from a job.

My advice is to communicate your situation with your bank proactively and in advance. Share documentary evidence of your new employment and agreed salary. If possible, ask your new employer to provide a salary transfer letter that you can give to your bank. The letter will help validate that the salary from your new employer will continue to be credited into your existing bank account. In your communications with the bank, mention that you intend to service the remaining instalments of your loan diligently and that you remain fully committed to clearing outstanding dues.

Banks in the UAE reserve the right to freeze the funds in a customer's salary-linked account once their end-of-service benefits are credited to the account. The final salary and gratuity credit would only trigger the bank to do so, if the customer has outstanding debts with it. This is a precautionary measure undertaken to ensure a customer does not default on his/her loans with the bank.

The terms and conditions set out by banks give them the right to freeze, suspend or put on hold the funds in a customer's account, as well as the right to set off these funds towards outstanding liabilities with the bank in a number of circumstances. These include non-payment of three consecutive or six non-consecutive instalments, suspicion around the borrower leaving the UAE permanently, and the gratuity being credited into the bank account signalling an end or termination of employment.

Many borrowers are unaware of the terms and conditions in their personal loan contracts, which give the bank complete authority to adjust the gratuity payment towards their outstanding loan with the bank.

It is standard protocol for employers in the UAE to release the final salary and gratuity (along with other end of employment benefits) all together. Therefore, asking your employer to split the payment may not work.

Your best option is to inform your bank in advance and provide them with details and proof of your new employment, such as a copy of the official offer letter. If you haven't missed or delayed any loan instalments in the past, your repayment record should help you negotiate more effectively.

If your account is blocked, give the bank an official salary transfer letter from the new employer along with your new employment visa and Emirates ID copy. To avoid facing a cash crunch while you figure this out with the bank, set some cash aside for the time being. Having another current or savings account, separate from your salary account, would help you avoid the hassle of being stranded without access to your primary account.

Debt panellist 3: Keren Bobker, an independent financial adviser with Holborn Assets

If you have an outstanding debt, whether a personal loan or a credit card balance, it is standard practice for banks in the UAE to freeze an account when advised by an employer that a payment is ""final salary"" and employers are supposed to do that.

Therefore, expect your account to be frozen when the payment is received as you have outstanding debts. When an account is frozen there is no access to any money in it and it cannot be partially frozen so there is no getting around it. The gratuity should be paid at the same time as the last salary payment. As you know this is going to happen, it would be wise to withdraw cash for interim expenses.

Note that not only will the account be frozen, you will also not be able to make any withdrawals or pay out any money. Depending on your lender, you may find that the gratuity payment is offset against the outstanding debt.

However, if the banks are aware you are starting a new job soon and have sight of an offer letter with the salary shown, there should be less chance of the gratuity being taken to pay down your debts. Some banks will not unfreeze accounts until they are given a new residency visa copy and a salary payment has been made.

As for the two cheques due to be paid while your account is frozen, contact both parties to explain the situation as neither the payment or the cheque will be honoured. You will need to come to an agreement with both parties either to pay early or for them to wait until your account is unfrozen. Let them know as soon as possible as people are often far more amenable about such matters if they are given plenty of notice.

79,uae central bank,10-05-2020,"It feels like a lifetime ago, but it has been just over 100 days since a family on holiday from China became the first Covid-19 cases reported in the UAE.

The group from the city of Wuhan – the centre of what was then not a full-blown pandemic – took their grandmother to a clinic with flu-like symptoms on January 23.

All four family members, including the parents and a girl, 9, were tested and found to have Covid-19. They had arrived in Dubai on an Emirates flight a week earlier.

At the time, the coronavirus was ravaging parts of China, with more people 80 dead and nearly 3,000 confirmed cases. Only a day before the news broke, Minister of Health Abdul Rahman Al Owais had declared the UAE to be free of the disease.

Liu Yujia, 73, the first woman to have coronavirus in the UAE recovers from the disease. Wam

However, the authorities knew it was only a matter of time before the contagion arrived and had acted accordingly.

The Ministry of Health and Prevention had put airports and entry points to the country on standby to monitor for possible cases at least a week earlier. By January 25, Etihad was screening passengers and crew arriving from China, with dedicated gates at Abu Dhabi airport and thermal cameras to detect symptoms.

At the same time, hospitals and health clinics were drawing up plans and running emergency drills for when – as seemed increasingly certain – not if, Covid-19 came to the UAE.

That fateful last week in January also gave the world and the UAE the first taste of what might be in store for their economies, as oil prices began what would turn out to be a long slide downward as demand began to fall.

Within days of the first UAE cases, concerns began to spread, with a huge surge in demand for face masks such that one online retailer was offering them for Dh699 each.

On February 1, another case was declared, another traveller from China, while a fall in demand led Emirates to switch to smaller planes on some of its routes to the country.

By February 22, an Iranian couple brought the number of UAE cases to 13, as the ending of the Venice Carnival gave a taste of what was soon to come, with Dubai private schools told to cancel all trips a week later and nurseries closed.

By the end of the month, the final stage of the UAE Tour had to be cancelled as two hotels on Yas Island were placed on lockdown after two Italian cyclists tested positive for coronavirus.

It was March when the storm truly broke, beginning with widespread cancellations and postponements and the closure of all schools for at least a month on March 3. The next day, orders were given for all football in the UAE to be played in empty stadiums, with the UAE’s World Cup qualifiers postponed on March 9.

That week, Art Dubai and Taste of Dubai were postponed, Global Village was closed and local cruise operations were suspended. By March 10, the number of UAE cases had risen to 74. A day later, shisha smoking was banned in “tourist establishments”.

On March 14, the UAE Central Bank rolled out a Dh100 billion stimulus package, ahead of much of the world, as oil prices continued their steep plunge. Across the country, gyms, theme parks and cinemas were closed.

The world was now pulling down the shutters. In mid-March, visas-on-arrival were cancelled for more than 70 countries, followed by the temporary suspension of entry for GCC citizens on March 21.

A day earlier came the sad news of the first two coronavirus-related deaths in the country, included a 78-year-old Arab national who had recently arrived from Europe.

March 23 will long be remembered. Malls and markets were ordered to close within 48 hours, except for those selling food and medicines. All flights were suspended and everyone told to stay at home unless “absolutely necessary”. The number of Covid-19 cases in the UAE topped 300, and banks were told only to use new notes in ATMs. A night curfew was introduced for deep cleaning of streets at the weekend of March 26.

The first rescue flights to bring home hundreds of Emiratis stranded overseas began in early April, while Emirates and Etihad announced the start of limited one-way repatriation flights for residents who wished to return home. Dubai closed its Metro for the first time since September 9, 2009.

By April 5, there had been 1,799 cases of Covid-19 in the UAE and 10 deaths. Across the country families settled to a new routine of working and studying from home, while Christians celebrated Easter on April 12 with remote services streamed from empty churches. From April 13, passengers leaving the country had a sticker placed on their passport reading “We’ll meet soon.”

By the middle of the month, the UAE had conducted nearly 650,000 Covid-19 tests, the third highest in the world per capita, diagnosing more than 4,000 cases but with 680 recoveries. These were carried out at hospitals, specialist centres and at least 14 drive-through testing facilities across the country.

A new hospital dedicated to Covid-19 patients opened at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City on April 23. It had been built in just 48 hours. Field hospitals were also built across the country to increase capacity.

By the end of April, there were the first signs of a return to a more normal life. Contactless card readers were introduced in Abu Dhabi taxis and several Dubai Metro stations opened on April 29. Hotels began to reopen, with facilities restricted to guests, while shopping malls were able to welcome back customers.

Just 100 days after the first known case, the UAE has recorded more than 16,000 infections, and sadly, as of May 7, 165 deaths.","It feels like a lifetime ago, but it has been just over 100 days since a family on holiday from China became the first Covid-19 cases reported in the UAE.

80,uae central bank,10-05-2020,"Abu Dhabi is introducing an initiative to boost exports from the emirate to 60 target markets worldwide in an effort to further expand its foreign trade.

The new digital platform, Abu Dhabi Export Gateway, will “offer an integrated approach” to exporting at least 100 local products from 10 different sectors, the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development said on Sunday.

The new project will further support local export companies. It will also expand their contribution to the emirate’s gross domestic product as efficiency, export capacity and investments improve, Mohammed Ali Al Shorafa, chairman of the department, said.

The first phase of the Abu Dhabi Export Gateway is set to be launched in August.

“The platform will cover more than 100 local products across 10 different sectors and industries and is designed to accommodate expansion as local exporters may add more products they wish to promote via the platform.”

The new platform will also provide statistics on local exports and information about the economic performance of crucial sectors in Abu Dhabi and the UAE.

Mr Al Shorafa said the 60 target markets across the world were chosen based on the emirate’s established connections, economic relations and mutual trade.

The team managing the project will frequently review the needs of local companies and demand in foreign markets during the next six months, Ghanem Al Mazrouei, the department's executive director of international economic relations, said.

“Based on the results, the platform will add other global markets and target sectors, as well as a range of smart digital services that would enhance local companies’ exporting capabilities and practices.”

The unveiling of the platform comes as the UAE launches new measures to support exporters affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, Etihad Credit Insurance, a federal entity, said it would extend export credit insurance and additional funding to exporters and businesses facing payment and supply chain disruptions.

It is offering financial support to domestic companies through bank loans.

Abu Dhabi also waived Dh246 million in penalties to support small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the commercial and industrial sectors earlier this year.

The waived fines are related to various economic infractions including licence renewal delays, engaging in additional economic activities not covered by an existing licence and the improper storage of goods in unsafe areas.","Abu Dhabi is introducing an initiative to boost exports from the emirate to 60 target markets worldwide in an effort to further expand its foreign trade.

81,uae central bank,10-05-2020,"Do you remember inflation? You will if you can recall the 1970s, when the oil shock, massive government deficits and spiralling wage demands drove price growth into double digits, and not just in developing countries.

In 1975, UK inflation hit an incredible 24 per cent, while in the US it topped out at 13.3 per cent in 1979, forcing the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates to a record 20 per cent in a bid to rein in prices.

Those numbers seem unthinkable at a time when central bankers have been struggling to hit inflation targets of 2 per cent a year, despite near-zero interest rates and huge fiscal and monetary stimulus.

Inflation could make a comeback, though, and faster than you think. Governments might even welcome its return, at first. Are they right to do so, and what would that mean for your investments?

As the Covid-19 pandemic hammers the global economy, deflation is the more obvious threat today. The US economy is forecast to fall a record 34 per cent in the second quarter, according to Goldman Sachs, while the unprecedented oil price crash sent futures towards minus $37 per barrel last month.

That could swiftly reverse as governments and central banks combat the pandemic with the world's biggest ever stimulus package, one that dwarfs their efforts after the 2008 financial crisis.

Central banks are likely to tolerate or even aim for above-target inflation, partly to compensate for years of missing targets, partly to help inflate away sovereign debt. Mark Richards, Jupiter

The Fed’s balance sheet soared from $4.16 trillion (Dh15.28tn) in February to a record $6.72tn by May 6, a rise of 60 per cent. By the end of the year, it could top $10tn. Other countries are following its lead and when those trillions hit the global economy, inflation could catch fire.

Moukarram Atassi, head of investment management at the National Bank of Fujairah, says globalisation, labour outsourcing, technology advances, China joining the World Trade Organisation, high public debt levels and the ageing population have kept inflation in check for decades.

We are now at a turning point for globalisation, as Covid-19 and trade tensions between the US and China change attitudes to supply chains. Instead of sending production offshore to cut costs, many businesses will bring it back home, a process known as ‘reshoring’.

“These trends are likely to drive up prices and trigger inflation, and we may now be at the beginning of a turnaround,” Mr Atassi says.

Mark Richards, multi-asset strategist at fund manager Jupiter, says monetary easing after the financial crisis did not trigger inflation, but this time may be different. “Central banks are likely to tolerate or even aim for above-target inflation, partly to compensate for years of missing targets, partly to help inflate away sovereign debt,” he says.

In true 1970s style, we might even see another oil shock, if the low prices hit supply by killing off US shale, while demand soars once the lockdown reverses.

Today, US crude trades at around $25 a barrel. Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris predicts it could hit $100 in just 18 months.

If the cost of petrol, food, clothes, holidays and borrowing starts to increase, consumers will suffer, especially if their wages do not keep up.

Many who have taken advantage of rock bottom interest rates will struggle to service their debt if interest rates hit 5 per cent, 10 per cent or even 15 per cent.

Last week, Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at New York University, took inflation warnings a step further, arguing that accelerated deglobalisation and renewed protectionism “make stagflation all but inevitable”.

Stagflation is what happens when a stagnating economy simultaneously suffers inflation, and is the worst of both worlds. There is a reason Mr Roubini is known as “Dr Doom”, but he prefers to think of himself as “Dr Realistic”.

Some say the inflation threat has been overdone. Jahangir Aka, managing director for the Middle East & Africa at fund manager Neuberger Berman, says it is hard to see amid falling gross domestic product, oversupply of commodities, and collapsing consumer confidence. “A decade of stimulus failed to generate inflation. More of the same is unlikely to achieve a different result,” he says.

Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS, says central banks are not attempting to stimulate the economy, but save it. “This is about making sure things do not get worse,"" he says. ""It is not about creating inflation, but preventing more disinflation.”

Central bankers are trying to keep the banking system and bond markets functioning, and match liquidity demand with supply. “None of this is stimulus. It is damage limitation,” adds Mr Donovan.

Dr Ryan Lemand, senior executive officer of ADS Investment Solutions, says the recovery will take a ""very, very long time”, as it will destroy demand. “Consumers will be put off buying that new car,"" he says. ""Companies will be reluctant to hire. I do not see inflation in these circumstances.”

Instead of preventing job losses and company foreclosures, today's stimulus will flood into the stock market, Mr Lemand says: “The Fed is even buying exchange traded funds, which is a direct injection into share prices.”

That largely explains the dramatic rebound in share prices since the lows of late March. Investors piled into shares in anticipation of stimulus-driven gains, even as the economic news got worse.

So where should you invest if we do get inflation? Mr Atassi says rising inflation tends to work well generally for tangible assets such as real estate, energy, precious metals, industrial metals and commodities.

Stock markets can perform well, but some companies are better placed to survive inflation than others. “Those with strong pricing power fare best, typically those operating in materials, commodities and energy. Utilities and telecom companies do well. Financials, consumer staples and the healthcare sector also tend to benefit, as they can pass on costs to customers,” Mr Atassi adds.

Other businesses will struggle, for example car makers, as buyers are priced out of the market.

Over time, inflation reduces the real value of money and Mr Richards says this is good news for gold, a traditional inflation hedge.

Inflation-linked bonds are also attractive, as the interest they pay will rise in line with prices. By contrast, bonds paying a fixed rate of interest will fall out of favour, as its real value shrinks.

Clem Chambers, founder of stocks and shares website Advfn.com, says cryptocurrency Bitcoin is another likely beneficiary. “Bitcoin loves trade wars, threats of military action and any other event that causes people to seek a safe haven, including inflation,"" he says. ""If inflation reigns going forward, its price will go off the dial. I’m currently amassing Bitcoin.”

Property can do well, as prices rise in line with inflation, as do rental incomes.

Arran Summerhill, director at Holo Mortgage Consultants, says this is good news for existing mortgage borrowers. “As property prices rise, mortgage loan-to-values should decrease in real terms, putting owners in a good position if they sell,” he says.

However, this is bad news for potential buyers, who will need larger deposits and may have to pay higher mortgage rates, Mr Summerhill adds.

Inflation creates winners as well as losers. That makes it dangerous, because many could welcome it at first. But if it gets out of control, everybody suffers.

People are nostalgic for the 1970s because of flares and Abba. Nobody wants to see a reprise of inflation, or worse, stagflation.","Other countries are following its lead and when those trillions hit the global economy, inflation could catch fire.

82,uae central bank,08-05-2020,"Al Baraka Banking Group, a Bahrain-based Sharia-compliant lender, plans to expand its footprint in Asia including India, China and Indonesia and is eyeing bank acquisitions as the coronavirus pandemic pushes valuations down, its chief executive said.

“We always acquire institutions outside [our home market]. This is what we did in Pakistan and this what we are going to do in future. If there is potential then why not – let’s acquire,” Adnan Yousif, told The National in a phone interview. “I believe the opportunity is there and we should not miss [out].”

Banks across the globe are at risk of reduced profitability as interest rates remain at historic lows and lenders increase their provisions in anticipation of a surge in bad loans. The pandemic, which has tipped the global economy into a recession, slated to be the deepest since the Great Depression, has dented lending, as businesses fold and non-performing loans rise.

Asset quality across the financial industry is under pressure, pushing prices down “not just for me but for everybody … Islamic or non-Islamic banks” who are looking for acquisitions, he said.

There’s no respite in sight in the short to medium term, and Mr Yousif expects valuations to remain low in the coming two to three years as banks will have to continue dealing with bad debts. Some lenders may even require additional capital in the future, offering institutions with stronger balance sheets a chance to pick up stakes.

Asia remains the focus of Al Baraka’s international expansion drive, Mr Yousif said. He, however, did not specify the timeline for entry into China, India or Indonesia, which is home to more than 220 million Muslims.

Al Baraka prefers to secure a banking licence in these markets, as acquisitions are complicated in these jurisdictions. However, if an opportunity to acquire a lender surfaces, the bank “will review it”, he said.

The lender plans to setup a small commercial bank in China focusing on trade financing to capitalise on growing commercial ties between the Asian country and the rest of the Muslim world.

In Indonesia, Al Baraka has already explored the possibility of taking a stake in Bank Muamalat three years ago and will continue to look for further opportunities, Mr Yousif said .

The bank also increased its shareholdings in its Jordanian and Egyptian subsidiaries a few years ago.

Al Baraka currently operates in Sudan, Turkey, South Africa, Algeria, Pakistan, Syria, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon.

Mr Yousif, who is also chairman of the Bahrain Association of Banks, sees the non-performing loans ratio climbing to 8-9 per cent of the total loans portfolio of lenders in the region amid the pandemic. Banks in the GCC, however, have very good capital adequacy levels and buffers to absorb the impact of bad debts, he said.

“We have a buffer of $36 billion (Dh132bn) in the GCC. Now we see central banks have also put flexibility … and I think for the time being central banks won’t insist on high capital adequacy,” Mr Yousif said.

He sees reduced profitability for lenders across the GCC this year and expects it will take at least two years for the banks to come back to pre-crisis profitability level.","Al Baraka Banking Group, a Bahrain-based Sharia-compliant lender, plans to expand its footprint in Asia including India, China and Indonesia and is eyeing bank acquisitions as the coronavirus pandemic pushes valuations down, its chief executive said.

83,uae central bank,07-05-2020,"Three-quarters of the Dh50 billion worth of interest-free loans, provided by the Central Bank of the UAE, to support businesses and individuals struggling as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic has been drawn down.

""To date, 75 per cent was already draw[n] down from the Dh50bn liquidity facility, equivalent to Dh37.2bn total consumption of allocated funds,"" the central bank said in a statement.

""During the past two weeks, additional banks have joined the scheme, increasing the total number of banks participating in TESS [Targeted Economic Support Scheme] to 24,"" it added.

The central bank first rolled out details of TESS in March as it unveiled a Dh100bn stimulus package to support companies and individuals affected by measures taken to stop the spread of the pandemic.

This included the Dh50bn of zero-cost collateralised loans now being drawn down and a loosening of banks' capital buffers, giving them more firepower to lend. Further loosening of capital and liquidity buffers has since increased the size of this stimulus to Dh256bn.

Banks have announced a series of measures to support customers, including three-month payment holidays on loans, cuts in interest rates and reductions in banking fees.

For businesses, the central bank ordered lenders to remove requirements for SMEs to have a minimum account balance of Dh10,000 before opening accounts and urged them to speed up account opening times to two days, unless potential customers were deemed to be high-risk under anti money-laundering rules.

For individuals, other support measures have included increasing the loan-to-value limit banks can offer on home loans, meaning the size of deposit required reduces to 20 per cent for first-time expatriate buyers and 15 per cent for Emiratis.

The central bank also said it will publish a list next week of the lenders that have availed more than 50 per cent of the funds allocated to them under TESS.","Three-quarters of the Dh50 billion worth of interest-free loans, provided by the Central Bank of the UAE, to support businesses and individuals struggling as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic has been drawn down.

84,uae central bank,07-05-2020,"Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad), a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Ports, rolled out new relief packages that provide up to 36 per cent savings for businesses operating in the freezone in an effort to support its customers amid Covid-19.

The new measures, available to both existing and prospective customers, offer savings of up to 25 per cent on new registrations and renewals while security deposit charges will be waived, Kizad said in a statement on Thursday.

“The SME relief packages we announced today are aligned with the UAE’s efforts to protect SMEs in the country from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic,” said Khalid Al Marzooqi, director commercial at Kizad.

“As one of the leading enablers of industry, it is our responsibility to provide businesses with the opportunities to be competitive in their respective markets.”

Companies that register or renew for three years will have 25 per cent in savings while those committing for two years will net 20 per cent in savings. One-year registrations will be able to avail just 15 per cent in savings, Kizad said.

The new initiative follows similar measures undertaken by Abu Dhabi Ports and implemented by Kizad to support customers affected by the global economic slowdown in the wake of Covid-19.

The measures announced by Abu Dhabi Ports recently include waiving penalties associated with the late renewal of licences in the second quarter of the year and rent deferment.

The UAE is gradually opening up after weeks of stay-at-home directives that were in place to contain the coronavirus. While malls and restaurants have had a phased opening in the country, remote working policies continue in an effort to adhere to social distancing.

Dubai Airport Freezone Authority (Dafza) on Thursday said it started a set of new initiatives to support its employees working remotely.

The new initiatives which include “Virtual Dafza staff forum’ are aimed at ensuring the continuity of business operations and enabling co-workers to effectively communicate, collaborate and share their achievements during this period, according to Dafza.

“Our initiatives aim to boost morale and provide support to our employees whilst they maintain social distancing, keeping spirits positive. This in turn drives the performance of all departments and the level of services, which our customers expect,” said Yousuf Behzad, assistant director-general of people growth and strategy at Dafza.

85,uae central bank,07-05-2020,"When Fahmi received the handover notice for his villa on Abu Dhabi’s Yas Island in mid-March, he faced a difficult decision: sell the property or apply for a mortgage to cover the outstanding balance.

Declining to give his full name, Fahmi looked into the rate over five years for a Dh2.5 million mortgage and found it to be expensive, costing “close to Dh180,000 in interest”.

Shortly thereafter, he came across a limited-time offer from the property developer Aldar through three lenders: a 1.99 per cent rate over five years with no application or valuation fees.

“Now with this offer, I’m only paying Dh113,000 over five years. You’re talking close to 40 per cent reduction,” says Fahmi. “It’s as cheap as getting a car loan.”

While he was leaning towards selling to free up capital amid the Covid-19 uncertainty, the “phenomenal” rate changed his mind.

I’ve been doing home finance in Dubai for 15 years now and it’s the lowest I’ve ever seen interest rates in the UAE Richard Boyd, director at Mortgage Finder

“When I looked at the mortgage rate and the monthly payments and the fact I’ve been here for 20 years paying rent, I thought ‘this is an opportune time for me to move to a house’,” he says.

As the coronavirus continues to spread worldwide and the global economy slips further into recession with millions of people losing their jobs, it may not seem like the opportune time to add the hefty financial commitment of paying for a mortgage.

However, favourable rates, fee waivers, a reduced loan-to-value ratio, bank payment holidays and the removal of the early settlement fee are all reasons to apply for a new home loan or renegotiate an existing one in the UAE.While there are factors to take into account, such as the decline of real estate prices in recent years and job security, mortgage brokers say property buyers should take advantage of exceptionally low borrowing costs.

With the US Federal Reserve slashing its benchmark interest rates to near zero in emergency moves in March, the UAE has seen interest rates come down significantly in that period, given that the dirham is pegged to the dollar.

The Central Bank of the UAE lowered its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.5 per cent in early March and then cut its rate on one-week certificates of deposit by 75 basis points a couple of weeks later.

Banks, as a result, have become more competitive with their mortgage offers. ""The central bank interest cuts has enabled banks to offer longer lower fixed rates and people who are on variable rates will also have seen a decline in their monthly payments for the most part,” says Stuart Roe, head of mortgages at Allsopp & Allsopp real estate agency.

As part of the central bank’s Dh256 billion stimulus package, borrowers can also benefit from loan relief from their banks for up to six months, while first-time home buyers are eligible for a 5 per cent increase in the loan-to-value ratio (up to 80 per cent for expatriates and 85 per cent for UAE nationals) and a full waiver of processing fees.

Home buyers can now get a mortgage for the lowest fixed rate of 2.7 per cent for one year, say brokers. Fixed rates for three to five years range from 2.99 per cent to 3.5 per cent. That is about 25 per cent cheaper than 12 months ago, when an average three-year fixed rate mortgage was 3.99 per cent, says Mr Boyd.

Arran Summerhill, director of UAE mortgage broker Holo, says banks are also offering “headline rates” to further attract customers. These are often limited in time or to specific properties.

For example, the Aldar offer is only available for 30 days from April 20 and applies to customers who have already purchased or are looking to purchase homes in Yas Acres, The Bridges on Al Reem Island, and Mamsha and Jawaher on Al Saadiyat Island.

Homeowners in those communities were able to apply for financing through Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank. Although subject to terms and conditions and approval, the offer included a rate from 1.99 per cent, fixed for three or five years, and up to six months’ deferral on first instalments.

Lower real estate prices have also been an important factor encouraging people in the UAE to get on the property ladder. Prices have gone down between 20 to 40 per cent over the last couple of years, says Mr Summerhill.

“The stimulus package and the decrease in the rates and the lower prices has offset some of the uncertainty in the market,” he says.

Over the last two months, mortgage applications through the Holo site have grown threefold. About 60 per cent are applications to refinance. Another trend is that about 80 per cent of applicants are end users, rather than investors, Mr Summerhill adds.

Mortgage Finder has seen a 15 per cent increase in mortgage applications in the first quarter of this year, compared to the same period in 2019. While there was a slight reduction during the coronavirus lockdown period, the numbers have gone up since movement restrictions were eased, Mr Boyd says.

Refinancing accounts for much of the increase in mortgage applications, according to brokers.

“Some clients are stuck still paying anywhere from 5 to 6 per cent, so potentially there’s good savings to switch,” Mr Boyd says.

In October, the central bank removed the 3 per cent early settlement fee for mortgages introduced in 2018 and reverted to a 1 per cent or Dh10,000 cap, whichever is lower.

Combined with low interest rates and increased lending, “it’s suddenly become a lot more relevant to look at refinancing the loans that they’ve had”, says Mr Summerhill.

There are some factors to consider, however, including the decline in property values, the percentage borrowed, the outstanding amount and the fees associated with moving to another lender.

“The downsides of switching mortgage lenders are that some people may not be able to leverage their position if their outstanding amount is less than 75 per cent of the value,” says Mr Roe.

It is still worth investigating, says Mr Summerhill. A valuation costs Dh2,500 to Dh3,500, but homeowners can get a free estimate of the value of their home at homevalue.ai.

However, it is at the discretion of banks how much to lend up to the maximum ratio, whether for a new mortgage or refinancing. As businesses and others affected by Covid-19 look to release equity from properties, some banks have reacted by limiting the amount, says Mr Summerhill.

“Some banks were only going up to 20 per cent as a maximum and they wanted to see if that was being used for property renovations,” he says. Other banks put a 50 per cent cap on “cash out”, while still others have been happy to lend at the normal limits of up to 80 per cent for a first property or up to 60 per cent for a second.

In these uncertain times, job security is another key consideration. “If you’ve lost your job and you’ve actually signed to buy a property, then that can be tricky because the bank may recall the finance offer,” says Mr Boyd.

The good news is that banks are being more flexible, with some lenders willing to offer “interest-only for up to a year to help”, he says. Even clients whose salaries have been cut have had mortgage applications approved, but it depends on the bank. Home buyers in hard-hit industries such as aviation and oil & gas may also get rejected.

For Fahmi, a senior manager with a UAE company, it helped that he had a “good standing” with his bank ADCB to apply for the mortgage. With “an attractive payment scheme” from Aldar, he was able to put 10 per cent as an initial down payment on the four-bedroom villa in 2016 and pay 20 per cent before handover. He chose to pay another Dh1m in cash, paying 50 per cent of the value of the Dh5m property before taking a mortgage.

Although he was wary of the current situation, he says he felt it was the right time to move to his own home with his wife and four children.

“It is dire and difficult for many people,"" he adds, ""but I found it too good of an offer to let go.”","Stuart Roe, head of mortgages at Allsopp & Allsopp, says bank rates have at their most competitive.

86,uae central bank,06-05-2020,"The General Administration of Abu Dhabi Customs rolled out an economic stimulus package to offset the impact of the coronavirus on businesses who use the emirate's ports for imports or as a transit gateway.

The new incentives include the postponement of customs duties for 90 days for importers through facilities accounts and the acceptance of institutional guarantees, instead of bank guarantees, for customs transactions.

Importers can also use pre-clearance services for clearing goods before they arrive in the country through the customs operations system. A self-clearance service allows companies to clear shipments on their own without relying on customs clearance and bond warehouses can be licenced without fees, the statement said. Companies can also issue a customs warehouse licence without the need to pay licence fees and can take items from customs warehouses without paying services fees, according to a statement.

The incentive package also includes the extension of the transit period of shipments from 3 to 5 days.

“The economic incentives package comes within the framework of Abu Dhabi government efforts to support continuously the economic system and companies, especially small and medium ones, in order to enhance the competitiveness of the emirate of Abu Dhabi and ensure business continuity for companies in all sectors,” Rashed Al Mansoori, director-general of the general administration of Abu Dhabi Customs, said.

The UAE was the first country in the Mena region to roll out fiscal and monetary support now totalling more than Dh282 billion, providing zero interest funding to encourage banks to lend in addition to a variety of other initiatives that range from discounted utility bills to waivers of government fees.

In March, the Abu Dhabi government announced a number of measures to support businesses in the emirate. The government allocated Dh5bn to subsidising water and electricity for citizens and commercial and industrial activities. It also reduced electricity connection fees for start-ups until the end of this year and exempted all commercial and industrial activities from Tawtheeq fees in 2020.

The emirate also allocated Dh3bn for an SME credit guarantee scheme, dedicated Dh1bn to establish a market maker fund to stabilise stock market pricing and issued directives to settle all approved government payables and invoices within 15 working days.","The General Administration of Abu Dhabi Customs rolled out an economic stimulus package to offset the impact of the coronavirus on businesses who use the emirate's ports for imports or as a transit gateway.

87,uae central bank,06-05-2020,"Saudi Arabia's Cabinet on Tuesday affirmed the Palestinian cause will remain a ""central issue"" for Arabs and Muslims, according to a statement issued by the Saudi news agency.

The Cabinet also reviewed the results of the emergency Arab League meeting, which condemned the Israeli authorities plans to annex any Palestinian land, the agency said on Wednesday.

The Palestinians have threatened to annul peace agreements if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu moved ahead with his plan.

The EU and the UN have also expressed strong opposition.

US officials say Washington is prepared to recognise Israeli action to extend its sovereignty over parts of the occupied West Bank.

The Arab foreign ministers' meeting said Israel was taking advantage of the world’s preoccupation with the coronavirus pandemic to push ahead with its annexation plan.

The meeting's communique said it amounted to a “new war crime to be added to Israel’s rich track record of horrific crimes against the Palestinians"".

It urged the US to withdraw its support for the annexation plan and abide by UN resolutions on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

The UAE condemned Israel's plan to annex large areas of the occupied West Bank during the emergency Arab League session attended by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr Anwar Gargash.

The meeting on Thursday was held at the request of the Palestinian Authority and conducted by video to observe rules of social distancing brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

The annexation plan ""is a dangerous development that would undermine international efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict"", the UAE said.

Israel's action is ""unacceptable, violates international law and impedes the peace process"", it said.

The UAE warned of ""dangerous repercussions"" and said the move could ""fuel"" extremism, and terrorism in the region"".

On Thursday, Jordan joined other Arab countries in condemning Mr Netanyahu's plan to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank, including Israel settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley. The annexation plan, which would extinguish Palestinian hopes of establishing an independent state that includes all of the West Bank, has drawn widespread international opposition.

88,uae central bank,06-05-2020,"Sudan has made yet another historic step forward in the past few days. On Saturday, the government approved a draft law to criminilise female genital mutilation and on Monday, Khartoum officially appointed its first ambassador to the United States in a quarter of a century. Sudan’s choice is Noureddine Sati, a well-known diplomat. His appointment comes after an ongoing strengthening of ties with Washington, culminating in the decision by both countries in December to exchange ambassadors. The US is yet to nominate its own chief diplomat in Khartoum.

American relations with Sudan are warming after decades of tensions under the rule of former dictator Omar Al Bashir. In 1993, Sudan was added to the US government’s list of state sponsors of terrorism as a result of Al Bashir’s support for extremist militant groups.

Al Bashir’s regime had gone so far as providing a safe harbour for Al Qaeda’s late leader Osama Bin Laden. The designation made it impossible for Khartoum to apply for much-needed financial assistance from international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund or the World bank. The terror listing also came with a host of economic sanctions, which were strengthened in 2006 after Al Bashir and his allies led an ethnic cleansing campaign in Sudan’s Darfur region.

In addition to international sanctions, incompetent governance and widespread corruption took a toll on the formerly oil-rich country’s economy. Under Al Bashir, Sudan was largely a one-man regime where every aspect of life, including the economy, was monopolised by the former leader and his entourage. This left no room for an independent banking sector to flourish or for ordinary Sudanese businesses and entrepreneurs to succeed. According to a report published by The Sentry, a watchdog for financial wrongdoing and war crimes in Africa, Al Bashir’s adopted son ran a complex scheme that allowed him to fund his own business operations using bank loans intended for the central government. The scam left Khartoum with crippling debt.

Sudan’s economic woes led to Al Bashir’s toppling last April. In December 2018, protests erupted in the capital against a sudden hike in the price of bread, fuel and other basic necessities, as well as a corresponding deterioration in living conditions. The protests quickly turned into a full-scale uprising.

In addition to international sanctions, incompetent governance and corruption took a toll on the economy

Today, Khartoum is working towards finding solutions to these pressing issues. Weeding out corruption and preventing pro-Al Bashir networks from reviving their grip on the economy are pivotal steps to building a better future for Sudan. As is opening up the country to the rest of the world, including the restoration of diplomatic ties with the US.

In the meantime, Sudan is in need of financial and humanitarian assistance, especially in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Gulf countries have been major supporters of Khartoum’s political and economic transition, with Saudi Arabia and the UAE alone pledging $3 billion in aid to the country.

Since Omar Al Bashir’s fall from power one year ago, Sudan has become a beacon for good governance and opportunity. After three decades of ruthless dictatorship, Khartoum cannot turn the page on its dark past overnight, but with its recent efforts the nation may be set to rise from its ashes and inspire the world.","American relations with Sudan are warming after decades of tensions under the rule of former dictator Omar Al Bashir.

89,uae central bank,06-05-2020,"I was made redundant last month and have already notified the bank. Now my account is frozen because I have a loan. Is there any way I can withdraw a small amount of money from my gratuity payment just to allow me to get by until I find another job? I am in quite a destitute situation, however, in the current situation, I am not sure how fast I can secure a new position.

My only debt is a personal loan, which I signed up for last year. The outstanding balance from the original Dh150,000 loan is Dh114,000 with monthly repayments of Dh3,800.

I asked the agent that sold me the loan if I could withdraw some money but he said the bank would not allow it. GM, Abu Dhabi

I was made redundant because the company is cutting costs. I asked the agent that sold me the loan if I could withdraw some money but he said the bank would not allow it. I do not have any money I can use at the moment. I have asked friends if I can borrow some money but everyone is holding on to what they have during the pandemic.

I used to earn Dh7,000 a month plus accommodation working in the hospitality sector. My previous employer is still allowing me to stay in the staff accommodation until further notice. I was told I could stay for a month but there has been no update so far.

I am from the Philippines and do not have any dependents in the UAE. My other expenses include Dh320 for my phone and I was sending between Dh2,000 to Dh5,000 for remittances when my salary was coming in. Whatever was left went towards food and toiletries for myself.

I understand and am aware of the agreement I had with the bank before I applied for the loan, but it's just a really difficult time now. I don't even know if I can go back home to the Philippines. I was told if I owe money in the bank, they will stop me in the airport and detain me. Is that true? This is why I am still trying to find a job here to pay back the money I owe and support my family back home.

I would just like to have some money on hand to help me get by until I get another job, so how do I get the bank to consider letting me withdraw some cash? GM, Abu Dhabi

Debt panellist 1: Philip King, head of retail banking at Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank

Unfortunately, the impact of the global pandemic continues to grow, leaving many individuals with unexpected job losses. We cannot begin to understand how difficult your situation is during such a distressing time.

Firstly, it is recommended that you refer back to the terms and conditions of your loan agreement to get some clarity on your rights and obligations in this situation. Typically, loan agreements include a clause which permits lenders to allocate end-of-service gratuity payments towards debt repayment. This is done as a safety measure for the lender, ensuring that the borrower will not default on any loan repayments.

However, given the current circumstances imposed by Covid-19, banks are being encouraged to be more flexible and accommodating in these matters. The Central Bank of the UAE has introduced a Dh256 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess) aimed at providing temporary financial relief for cash-strapped individuals, SMEs and other private businesses affected by the pandemic.

Under the Tess programme, banks and finance companies are encouraged to extend their customers’ deferrals of principal and interest, accommodate repayment holiday requests and provide debt consolidation solutions.

It is highly advisable to approach your lender, explain your current circumstances, and try to leverage from these measures. It would be helpful to provide documentation from your employer that states Covid-19 as the reason for your termination. Depending on your agreement with the bank, you can renegotiate the terms of your personal finance with reduced interest payments and a longer tenure.

While the current period may seem discouraging, we urge you to continue your job hunt. This shows your commitment to repaying your debt and reassures your lender you are taking your financial obligations seriously.

Debt panellist 2: Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of Souqalmal.com

It has been standard protocol for UAE banks to add a clause in the terms and conditions of personal loan contracts, which allows them to use a customer's end-of-service payment towards an outstanding loan with the bank. This payment normally includes a gratuity entitlement, final salary payment, severance package or redundancy payment, pay in lieu of notice period and unused leave. This assignment to the bank is the usual practice followed by most banks in the country, and unfortunately one that most borrowers are unaware of.

Normally, the bank would reassign the end-of-service payment if the borrower submits a request in writing and there is no outstanding loan balance remaining. However, the current situation is an unprecedented one. Although this payment offset clause has not been relaxed in the recently released financial relief measures by banks, it may be worthwhile speaking to your bank about it. Now that the movement restrictions have been eased, you can visit the bank branch and speak to a bank representative.

Assuming you have already applied for the deferred payment facility for three months, explain to the bank that you need survival money to sustain yourself until you find another job. Ask the bank if they can release the last salary component and/or airfare allowance. Based on the loan contract, some banks may only have a legal right to withhold the gratuity rather than any other payments and allowances from the employer.

As for your future job prospects in the UAE, have you looked at the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation new initiative – UAE's Virtual Labour Market? Register yourself on the portal to access both temporary and permanent positions open in the country. Besides this, keep looking for roles, even part-time or freelance opportunities yourself, targeting sectors that have seen ongoing demand during this crisis such as e-commerce, logistics and delivery.

Debt panellist 3: Stuart Ritchie, chartered financial planner at AES International

The central bank permits banks to freeze accounts for various reasons, such as loss of employment, or upon receiving an individual’s gratuity payment. It is standard practice for an employer to pay the benefit as a separate payment to salary and label it as such. The only way to have a bank account unfrozen is to submit proof you have secured new employment, by providing a salary letter from your new employer, or by paying off any outstanding debts.

There are a few potential options regarding the loan; many banks are offering various initiatives to help those affected by Covid-19. It would be worth speaking with your bank directly about potentially deferring your loan repayments for as long as possible and exploring if there is any scope to freeze the interest being charged and temporarily stop any other fees. This will at least prevent the debt from increasing while you remain unemployed and seek alternative work.

Regarding your query about leaving the UAE and returning to the Philippines; this is possible, but you must speak to your bank before leaving the country to come to an arrangement regarding the outstanding debt. The bank can apply for a travel ban to prevent you from leaving the country. However, if they are satisfied that you will have a greater chance of securing employment in the Philippines or elsewhere, and they do not believe you intend to abscond from your debts, they may allow you to leave the country. Your chances of being permitted to leave will be greater if you have kept up to date with all previous loan payments and never defaulted in the past. Therefore, it is worth having this conversation with your bank to understand your options more fully.

The first phase of the project will include villas, a private beach, a marina and a wellness retreat.

Dhabi Contracting will construct 146 residential and two show villas over a total area of 5.78 hectares at Sahel al Emarat, Imkan said on Sunday. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2022.

“Our priority in choosing a construction partner for this project was to work with one that shares our ethos and beliefs,” said Imkan’s chief executive Walid El Hindi. “We are confident that Dhabi will play a vital role in the smooth delivery of Al Jurf to the best standard while – most importantly –protecting Al Jurf’s natural habitat and ecosystem.”

Set up in 1983, Dhabi Contracting's project portfolio includes Al Khail Avenue Mall, Adnoc’s villas in Ruwais and Le Royal Meridian Abu Dhabi .

“As a company that has played a major role in the growth of the UAE, with its numerous specialised developments, we will be drawing on our unrivalled expertise to bring to life this premium lifestyle concept,” said Dhabi Contracting’s general manager Samy Edward.

Al Jurf will also house Sha Emirates, a branch of European wellness clinic and retreat, Sha Wellness.

A wholly owned subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Capital Group, Imkan has a portfolio of 26 projects worth Dh100 billion in different countries such as the UAE, Egypt, Morocco, Seychelles and Sri Lanka.

Last year, it launched Le Carrousel, a 10ha development along the Atlantic coast in Morocco. The total investment in the mixed-use project is 1.5bn Moroccan dirhams (Dh558 m).

The company is also looking to expand in Egypt, where it purchased a 67.17ha plot from the Egyptian government to develop a mixed-use project in New Cairo near the American University campus for 4bn Egyptian pounds (Dh934 m) last year.

In Abu Dhabi, Imkan's projects under development include Pixel, a mixed-use scheme in its Makers District development on Reem Island; Nudra, a luxury beachside villa community; and Sheikha Fatima Park, with retail and food and beverage outlets.

91,uae central bank,03-05-2020,"The National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah (RAKBank) reported a 43 per cent drop in first-quarter net profit on higher provisions for expected loan losses as a coronavirus-linked economic slowdown ensues.

Net profit attributable to owners of the bank for the three months ending March 31 declined to Dh153 million, the lender said in a statement to the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, where its shares trade. Profit for the period fell “due to higher IFRS 9 provisions that are set as precautionary measures to combat the economic impact of the novel coronavirus"", the lender said.

Net provision for credit loss climbed 39 per cent year-on-year to Dh480.4m. Net interest income and net income from Islamic financing also rose almost 2 per cent to Dh696m, while non-interest income dropped 4 per cent to Dh305m during the period.

“Like most banks globally we have taken the pre-emptive judgemental overlays in our IFRS 9 provisions to factor in the challenges that lie ahead, which has led to additional provisions of just over Dh130m for the quarter,” RAKBank chief executive Peter England said in a statement.

“RAKBank is very well positioned to weather the current challenges with very high levels of capital, liquidity and precautionary provisions, leaving us in a very strong position to help our clients through these very challenging times.”

General and administrative expenses of the bank dropped 4.49 per cent year-on-year to Dh367.2m.

Total assets at the end of the first quarter grew 4.6 per cent to Dh59.8bn, but loans and advances dropped almost 1 per cent from the end of the last year to Dh34.3bn. Customer deposits increased 3 per cent to Dh37.8bn during the first three months of 2020.

Lenders worldwide are facing a decline in profitability as loan growth slows and interest rates fall as central banks embark on monetary easing measures to support their economies.

The global economy is facing its deepest recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s and is projected to shrink 3 per cent in 2020, the International Monetary Fund said last month. The outlook is worse than the 2008 financial crisis and the IMF does not expect a recovery to take place before 2021.

The UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, has rolled out Dh282bn in fiscal and monetary support, including a Dh256bn package of measures from the central bank, which has provided zero interest funding to banks to encourage lending growth, as well as relaxing capital and liquidity buffers. Other government initiatives range from discounted utility bills to postponement and waivers of various fees.

“We are continuously monitoring the developments of Covid-19 and are always prepared to support our customers facing financial hardship or loss of income due to its economic impact on individuals, SMEs and corporates, including elimination or reduction of many fees and rates,” Mr England added.

“These measures were made possible with the support of the Central Bank of the UAE’s financial stimulus packages that directly benefitted customers by relieving them of their financial burdens during the health crisis.”","The National Bank of Ras Al-Khaimah (RAKBank) reported a 43 per cent drop in first-quarter net profit on higher provisions for expected loan losses as a coronavirus-linked economic slowdown ensues.

92,uae central bank,02-05-2020,"Dubai's retail sector will see a gradual recovery by the middle of 2021 as it carefully emerges from the coronavirus crisis that disrupted tourism, the chairman of Emaar Properties, the emirate's largest listed developer, said after Dubai Mall reopened.

Dubai will rebound from the crisis in ""better shape"" than other cities across the world, thanks to the size of its commercial hub and its lack of dependence on oil, Mohamed Alabbar, the mall's developer , told CNN .

""I don't see a V-shape,"" he said when asked about a timetable for a recovery based on data from businesses such as Dubai Mall and Noon.com.

""I expect that we really have to go gradually, moving upward towards the end of the year, if there’s no major outbreak there, then probably into end the of the first quarter next year to mid-next year maybe we’re back to normal.""

Dubai, a regional tourism and business hub, imposed strict restrictions on movement and commercial activities in an effort to containing the Covid-19 virus.

In April, Dubai announced it would partially reopen its shopping malls after more than three weeks of restrictions. The malls, however, will be required to operate at 30 per cent of capacity.

The government's decision highlights the importance of the sector as a crucial pillar in Dubai's economy and a major draw for tourists under normal circumstances.

In the UAE and around the world, governments are weighing the difficult decision between protecting public health and reopening their economies as businesses buckle under the financial strain of prolonged closures.

Mr Alabbar said the re opening during the start of Ramadan, the ""slowest two weeks of the year"", provides the opportunity to ""try to come back carefully, gradually "" and to ""fine-tune and adjust"".

Economies in the Middle East and Central Asia are projected to contract 2.8 per cent in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and falling oil prices, according to the International Monetary Fund.

""Global cities will go through change and adjustment, some better than others,"" Mr Alabbar said. ""With [the] size of this city and the policy of government and no dependence on oil, the chance of this city to go back, it will go back, and we will be in better shape.""

The UAE, the Arab world's second-biggest economy, introduced Dh282 billion in fiscal and monetary support , providing zero interest funding to banks to boost lending growth in the country.

The government has also launched a variety of other initiatives that range from discounted utility bills to waivers of fees to buttress the economy.

The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the global economy, which is set to contract 3 per cent this year and is projected to slide into the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

The outbreak has hindered international trade and paralysed the airline and hospitality industries.

The pandemic also led to the delay of major global events such as the Tokyo Olympics and the Expo 2020 Dubai until next year and the cancellation of the Hannover Messe for the first time in its 73-year history.

The IMF and World Bank were forced to hold their Spring Meetings online last month.

Mr Alabbar said hosting the world fair in 2021 would be ""an ideal time "".

""I'm 100 per cent sure the vaccine will be with us even if it goes to next year March or April, and I believe by October we should be all fine to really use the Expo as a time of celebration and reunite the world after these times,"" he said.","Dubai's retail sector will see a gradual recovery by the middle of 2021 as it carefully emerges from the coronavirus crisis that disrupted tourism, the chairman of Emaar Properties, the emirate's largest listed developer, said after Dubai Mall reopened.
""I don't see a V-shape,"" he said when asked about a timetable for a recovery based on data from businesses such as Dubai Mall and Noon.com.
Dubai, a regional tourism and business hub, imposed strict restrictions on movement and commercial activities in an effort to containing the Covid-19 virus.
In April, Dubai announced it would partially reopen its shopping malls after more than three weeks of restrictions.

93,uae central bank,02-05-2020,"When I joined my company, I signed an offer letter but later on I noticed the employment contract was different. I refused to sign this, but they said they did not want to pay such heavy government fees so they had to reduce my basic salary but will pay me the extra. On the labour contract, my basic salary is Dh600 but on the offer letter it was Dh1,400 per month. I asked my boss for proof I will be paid the higher amount and she wrote that on the employment contract. Now she does not want to pay me and even wants to reduce my salary by 50 per cent. I want to quit my job but she is stopping me as she has my passport. I work from 7am to 9pm on some days and from 7am to 10:30pm on others. I have also discovered that my employer has posted my job position online. What can I do? IO, Ajman

No employee should be treated in this manner and the employer is not acting fairly. The company is a limited liability company which means it has a mainland licence and UAE Labour Law applies.

I have seen the offer letter and it states a salary of Dh1,400 but there is also an illegal clause that says the employer will charge the employee for visa costs. This is not permissible under UAE Law.

While the employer said the reason for the lower salary was to reduce its costs, this is unlikely as visa costs do not change for different salaries for the same role. I am sure the company is aware that in the labour courts, the contract lodged with the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) is the one that matters. For IO, this is the contract that states a salary of Dh600 per month.

Under UAE law, an employer cannot reduce a salary without the agreement of the employee, and this has been reiterated in the recent Ministerial Resolution (No 279 of 2020). It has also been made clear by the UAE authorities, on multiple occasions, that employers should not retain passports.

IO is on a limited term contract so if he resigns, he will have to pay a penalty to the employer in accordance with Article 116 of UAE Labour Law. This is equivalent to 45 days of salary, but if he makes a case against the employer there is a possibility this could be waived.

Finally, if the employer is advertising the exact same position and then makes IO redundant without an acceptable reason, he would have a good case for claiming arbitrary dismissal in accordance with Article 122 and 123 which could lead to some compensation.

I urge IO to register a case with MoHRE against the company for: the salary cuts, the excessive hours, the passport retention and potentially arbitrary dismissal.

I have a mortgage with a UAE bank that is linked to the Eibor (Emirates Interbank Offered Rate). I read that the UAE interest rates were cut last month but I haven’t been informed of a drop in my mortgage rate and when I asked I was told that there wouldn’t be one. Shouldn’t these cuts be passed on to customers every time? Can I check the rate myself to make sure I am being correctly charged? HS, Dubai

Eibor is the interest rate at which banks lend to each other. This changes daily and is published on the Central Bank of the UAE's website. This is not the same as the bank base rate which was reduced in mid-March.

Most banks in the UAE use Eibor when setting the rate of interest payable on a mortgage, but it is the rate plus a margin as banks are businesses and need to make a profit. Banks use the three-month Eibor rate, as it is impractical to link to a rate that changes daily.

When it comes to checking if a borrower is being charged correctly, the details will be in the small print. This explains how the rate is calculated, how often it can change and also if there is a minimum rate. It is not uncommon for a mortgage to have a ‘floor’, a minimum below which the rate will not fall, when it comes to borrowing. All borrowers need to ask these questions when taking out a mortgage, or indeed any other loan, so they fully understand the conditions and any future changes to the rate of interest payable, whether an increase or a decrease.

94,abu dhabi islamic bank,07-05-2020,"When Fahmi received the handover notice for his villa on Abu Dhabi’s Yas Island in mid-March, he faced a difficult decision: sell the property or apply for a mortgage to cover the outstanding balance.

Declining to give his full name, Fahmi looked into the rate over five years for a Dh2.5 million mortgage and found it to be expensive, costing “close to Dh180,000 in interest”.

Shortly thereafter, he came across a limited-time offer from the property developer Aldar through three lenders: a 1.99 per cent rate over five years with no application or valuation fees.

“Now with this offer, I’m only paying Dh113,000 over five years. You’re talking close to 40 per cent reduction,” says Fahmi. “It’s as cheap as getting a car loan.”

While he was leaning towards selling to free up capital amid the Covid-19 uncertainty, the “phenomenal” rate changed his mind.

I’ve been doing home finance in Dubai for 15 years now and it’s the lowest I’ve ever seen interest rates in the UAE Richard Boyd, director at Mortgage Finder

“When I looked at the mortgage rate and the monthly payments and the fact I’ve been here for 20 years paying rent, I thought ‘this is an opportune time for me to move to a house’,” he says.

As the coronavirus continues to spread worldwide and the global economy slips further into recession with millions of people losing their jobs, it may not seem like the opportune time to add the hefty financial commitment of paying for a mortgage.

However, favourable rates, fee waivers, a reduced loan-to-value ratio, bank payment holidays and the removal of the early settlement fee are all reasons to apply for a new home loan or renegotiate an existing one in the UAE.While there are factors to take into account, such as the decline of real estate prices in recent years and job security, mortgage brokers say property buyers should take advantage of exceptionally low borrowing costs.

“I’ve been doing home finance in Dubai for 15 years now and it’s the lowest I’ve ever seen interest rates in the UAE,” says Richard Boyd, director at Mortgage Finder, part of the Property Finder Group.

With the US Federal Reserve slashing its benchmark interest rates to near zero in emergency moves in March, the UAE has seen interest rates come down significantly in that period, given that the dirham is pegged to the dollar.

The Central Bank of the UAE lowered its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.5 per cent in early March and then cut its rate on one-week certificates of deposit by 75 basis points a couple of weeks later.

Banks, as a result, have become more competitive with their mortgage offers. ""The central bank interest cuts has enabled banks to offer longer lower fixed rates and people who are on variable rates will also have seen a decline in their monthly payments for the most part,” says Stuart Roe, head of mortgages at Allsopp & Allsopp real estate agency.

As part of the central bank’s Dh256 billion stimulus package, borrowers can also benefit from loan relief from their banks for up to six months, while first-time home buyers are eligible for a 5 per cent increase in the loan-to-value ratio (up to 80 per cent for expatriates and 85 per cent for UAE nationals) and a full waiver of processing fees.

Home buyers can now get a mortgage for the lowest fixed rate of 2.7 per cent for one year, say brokers. Fixed rates for three to five years range from 2.99 per cent to 3.5 per cent. That is about 25 per cent cheaper than 12 months ago, when an average three-year fixed rate mortgage was 3.99 per cent, says Mr Boyd.

Arran Summerhill, director of UAE mortgage broker Holo, says banks are also offering “headline rates” to further attract customers. These are often limited in time or to specific properties.

For example, the Aldar offer is only available for 30 days from April 20 and applies to customers who have already purchased or are looking to purchase homes in Yas Acres, The Bridges on Al Reem Island, and Mamsha and Jawaher on Al Saadiyat Island.

Homeowners in those communities were able to apply for financing through Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank. Although subject to terms and conditions and approval, the offer included a rate from 1.99 per cent, fixed for three or five years, and up to six months’ deferral on first instalments.

Lower real estate prices have also been an important factor encouraging people in the UAE to get on the property ladder. Prices have gone down between 20 to 40 per cent over the last couple of years, says Mr Summerhill.

“The stimulus package and the decrease in the rates and the lower prices has offset some of the uncertainty in the market,” he says.

Over the last two months, mortgage applications through the Holo site have grown threefold. About 60 per cent are applications to refinance. Another trend is that about 80 per cent of applicants are end users, rather than investors, Mr Summerhill adds.

Mortgage Finder has seen a 15 per cent increase in mortgage applications in the first quarter of this year, compared to the same period in 2019. While there was a slight reduction during the coronavirus lockdown period, the numbers have gone up since movement restrictions were eased, Mr Boyd says.

Refinancing accounts for much of the increase in mortgage applications, according to brokers.

“Some clients are stuck still paying anywhere from 5 to 6 per cent, so potentially there’s good savings to switch,” Mr Boyd says.

In October, the central bank removed the 3 per cent early settlement fee for mortgages introduced in 2018 and reverted to a 1 per cent or Dh10,000 cap, whichever is lower.

Combined with low interest rates and increased lending, “it’s suddenly become a lot more relevant to look at refinancing the loans that they’ve had”, says Mr Summerhill.

There are some factors to consider, however, including the decline in property values, the percentage borrowed, the outstanding amount and the fees associated with moving to another lender.

“The downsides of switching mortgage lenders are that some people may not be able to leverage their position if their outstanding amount is less than 75 per cent of the value,” says Mr Roe.

It is still worth investigating, says Mr Summerhill. A valuation costs Dh2,500 to Dh3,500, but homeowners can get a free estimate of the value of their home at homevalue.ai.

However, it is at the discretion of banks how much to lend up to the maximum ratio, whether for a new mortgage or refinancing. As businesses and others affected by Covid-19 look to release equity from properties, some banks have reacted by limiting the amount, says Mr Summerhill.

“Some banks were only going up to 20 per cent as a maximum and they wanted to see if that was being used for property renovations,” he says. Other banks put a 50 per cent cap on “cash out”, while still others have been happy to lend at the normal limits of up to 80 per cent for a first property or up to 60 per cent for a second.

In these uncertain times, job security is another key consideration. “If you’ve lost your job and you’ve actually signed to buy a property, then that can be tricky because the bank may recall the finance offer,” says Mr Boyd.

The good news is that banks are being more flexible, with some lenders willing to offer “interest-only for up to a year to help”, he says. Even clients whose salaries have been cut have had mortgage applications approved, but it depends on the bank. Home buyers in hard-hit industries such as aviation and oil & gas may also get rejected.

For Fahmi, a senior manager with a UAE company, it helped that he had a “good standing” with his bank ADCB to apply for the mortgage. With “an attractive payment scheme” from Aldar, he was able to put 10 per cent as an initial down payment on the four-bedroom villa in 2016 and pay 20 per cent before handover. He chose to pay another Dh1m in cash, paying 50 per cent of the value of the Dh5m property before taking a mortgage.

Although he was wary of the current situation, he says he felt it was the right time to move to his own home with his wife and four children.

“It is dire and difficult for many people,"" he adds, ""but I found it too good of an offer to let go.”","Stuart Roe, head of mortgages at Allsopp & Allsopp, says bank rates have at their most competitive.

95,abu dhabi islamic bank,06-05-2020,"I was made redundant last month and have already notified the bank. Now my account is frozen because I have a loan. Is there any way I can withdraw a small amount of money from my gratuity payment just to allow me to get by until I find another job? I am in quite a destitute situation, however, in the current situation, I am not sure how fast I can secure a new position.

My only debt is a personal loan, which I signed up for last year. The outstanding balance from the original Dh150,000 loan is Dh114,000 with monthly repayments of Dh3,800.

I asked the agent that sold me the loan if I could withdraw some money but he said the bank would not allow it. GM, Abu Dhabi

I was made redundant because the company is cutting costs. I asked the agent that sold me the loan if I could withdraw some money but he said the bank would not allow it. I do not have any money I can use at the moment. I have asked friends if I can borrow some money but everyone is holding on to what they have during the pandemic.

I used to earn Dh7,000 a month plus accommodation working in the hospitality sector. My previous employer is still allowing me to stay in the staff accommodation until further notice. I was told I could stay for a month but there has been no update so far.

I am from the Philippines and do not have any dependents in the UAE. My other expenses include Dh320 for my phone and I was sending between Dh2,000 to Dh5,000 for remittances when my salary was coming in. Whatever was left went towards food and toiletries for myself.

I understand and am aware of the agreement I had with the bank before I applied for the loan, but it's just a really difficult time now. I don't even know if I can go back home to the Philippines. I was told if I owe money in the bank, they will stop me in the airport and detain me. Is that true? This is why I am still trying to find a job here to pay back the money I owe and support my family back home.

I would just like to have some money on hand to help me get by until I get another job, so how do I get the bank to consider letting me withdraw some cash? GM, Abu Dhabi

Unfortunately, the impact of the global pandemic continues to grow, leaving many individuals with unexpected job losses. We cannot begin to understand how difficult your situation is during such a distressing time.

Firstly, it is recommended that you refer back to the terms and conditions of your loan agreement to get some clarity on your rights and obligations in this situation. Typically, loan agreements include a clause which permits lenders to allocate end-of-service gratuity payments towards debt repayment. This is done as a safety measure for the lender, ensuring that the borrower will not default on any loan repayments.

However, given the current circumstances imposed by Covid-19, banks are being encouraged to be more flexible and accommodating in these matters. The Central Bank of the UAE has introduced a Dh256 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess) aimed at providing temporary financial relief for cash-strapped individuals, SMEs and other private businesses affected by the pandemic.

Under the Tess programme, banks and finance companies are encouraged to extend their customers’ deferrals of principal and interest, accommodate repayment holiday requests and provide debt consolidation solutions.

It is highly advisable to approach your lender, explain your current circumstances, and try to leverage from these measures. It would be helpful to provide documentation from your employer that states Covid-19 as the reason for your termination. Depending on your agreement with the bank, you can renegotiate the terms of your personal finance with reduced interest payments and a longer tenure.

While the current period may seem discouraging, we urge you to continue your job hunt. This shows your commitment to repaying your debt and reassures your lender you are taking your financial obligations seriously.

Debt panellist 2: Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of Souqalmal.com

It has been standard protocol for UAE banks to add a clause in the terms and conditions of personal loan contracts, which allows them to use a customer's end-of-service payment towards an outstanding loan with the bank. This payment normally includes a gratuity entitlement, final salary payment, severance package or redundancy payment, pay in lieu of notice period and unused leave. This assignment to the bank is the usual practice followed by most banks in the country, and unfortunately one that most borrowers are unaware of.

Normally, the bank would reassign the end-of-service payment if the borrower submits a request in writing and there is no outstanding loan balance remaining. However, the current situation is an unprecedented one. Although this payment offset clause has not been relaxed in the recently released financial relief measures by banks, it may be worthwhile speaking to your bank about it. Now that the movement restrictions have been eased, you can visit the bank branch and speak to a bank representative.

Assuming you have already applied for the deferred payment facility for three months, explain to the bank that you need survival money to sustain yourself until you find another job. Ask the bank if they can release the last salary component and/or airfare allowance. Based on the loan contract, some banks may only have a legal right to withhold the gratuity rather than any other payments and allowances from the employer.

As for your future job prospects in the UAE, have you looked at the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation new initiative – UAE's Virtual Labour Market? Register yourself on the portal to access both temporary and permanent positions open in the country. Besides this, keep looking for roles, even part-time or freelance opportunities yourself, targeting sectors that have seen ongoing demand during this crisis such as e-commerce, logistics and delivery.

Debt panellist 3: Stuart Ritchie, chartered financial planner at AES International

The central bank permits banks to freeze accounts for various reasons, such as loss of employment, or upon receiving an individual’s gratuity payment. It is standard practice for an employer to pay the benefit as a separate payment to salary and label it as such. The only way to have a bank account unfrozen is to submit proof you have secured new employment, by providing a salary letter from your new employer, or by paying off any outstanding debts.

There are a few potential options regarding the loan; many banks are offering various initiatives to help those affected by Covid-19. It would be worth speaking with your bank directly about potentially deferring your loan repayments for as long as possible and exploring if there is any scope to freeze the interest being charged and temporarily stop any other fees. This will at least prevent the debt from increasing while you remain unemployed and seek alternative work.

Regarding your query about leaving the UAE and returning to the Philippines; this is possible, but you must speak to your bank before leaving the country to come to an arrangement regarding the outstanding debt. The bank can apply for a travel ban to prevent you from leaving the country. However, if they are satisfied that you will have a greater chance of securing employment in the Philippines or elsewhere, and they do not believe you intend to abscond from your debts, they may allow you to leave the country. Your chances of being permitted to leave will be greater if you have kept up to date with all previous loan payments and never defaulted in the past. Therefore, it is worth having this conversation with your bank to understand your options more fully.

Profit for the period fell “due to higher IFRS 9 provisions that are set as precautionary measures to combat the economic impact of the novel coronavirus"", the lender said.

Net provision for credit loss climbed 39 per cent year-on-year to Dh480.4m. Net interest income and net income from Islamic financing also rose almost 2 per cent to Dh696m, while non-interest income dropped 4 per cent to Dh305m during the period.

General and administrative expenses of the bank dropped 4.49 per cent year-on-year to Dh367.2m.

Total assets at the end of the first quarter grew 4.6 per cent to Dh59.8bn, but loans and advances dropped almost 1 per cent from the end of the last year to Dh34.3bn. Customer deposits increased 3 per cent to Dh37.8bn during the first three months of 2020.

Lenders worldwide are facing a decline in profitability as loan growth slows and interest rates fall as central banks embark on monetary easing measures to support their economies.

The global economy is facing its deepest recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s and is projected to shrink 3 per cent in 2020, the International Monetary Fund said last month. The outlook is worse than the 2008 financial crisis and the IMF does not expect a recovery to take place before 2021.

“We are continuously monitoring the developments of Covid-19 and are always prepared to support our customers facing financial hardship or loss of income due to its economic impact on individuals, SMEs and corporates, including elimination or reduction of many fees and rates,” Mr England added.

Abu Dhabi, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the world’s proven oil reserves, last month, rolled out an economic stimulus package to help soften the impact of the coronavirus on its economy. The economic relief scheme includes 16 initiatives aimed at reducing the costs of living and supporting businesses in the emirate.

Earlier in April Abu Dhabi’s department of finance teamed up with three of the emirate’s top lenders to expand the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme introduced as part of Abu Dhabi’s economic stimulus.

Under the deal with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and the country's biggest lender First Abu Dhabi Bank, the government is guaranteeing up to 80 per cent of the value of the scheme extended to SMEs, it said in an April 16 statement.

The pact provides SMEs with wider access to renewable financing options for working capital loans for a three-month duration and term loans for up to four-year duration to support further investment in Abu Dhabi, the department of finance said at the time.

Lenders in the UAE have already rolled out a comprehensive package to reduce financial distress of their customers including relief for their SME clients, through reduced costs and fees, loan deferrals and reduced interest rates and processing fees.

As we battle the coronavirus pandemic together, frontline workers and the disadvantaged are vulnerable. Thankfully, there are a few great initiatives that allow us all to help out among UAE communities.

Here are six worth looking into.

1. 10 Million Meals

What is it? The 10 Million Meals campaign is easily the UAE's biggest community drive and was launched by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives in collaboration with Social Solidarity Fund Against Covid-19. It aims to provide food assistance to less fortunate families and individuals, by allowing everyone to financially contribute towards providing meals, or donating food items and parcels, directly to those in need across the UAE.

How can you donate? A huge number of companies and restaurants across the UAE have donated meals – more than 15,000 donors pledged 450,000 meals in two days – but there are a number of ways we can all still get involved.

4. Buy meals with Inked

What is it? Dubai restaurant Inked, which is based in Alserkal Avenue, has been using its kitchen to cook meals for vulnerable communities and front-line healthcare workers in the city.

Kenza and Patrick Jarjour, the husband-and-wife team behind the dining and event space wanted to “give back to the community of Dubai” after they closed their two kitchens amid the coronavirus crisis.

For a couple of weeks, they have been cooking about 100 meals a day, taking donations from their suppliers who were left with a food surplus because of the mass closure of restaurants. They now hope to up this to 300 meals a day, helped by Alserkal Avenue’s Pay it Forward initiative.

Look through the photo gallery below to see the team busy in the kitchen:

It has been working with the UAE Food Bank to determine where these meals go. Some go to vulnerable communities facing food shortages, such as those in Al Ras and Al Quoz. Others, administered by the Dubai Health Authority, go to front-line workers and patients.

How can you donate? The restaurant is seeking donations of Dh25 per meal to continue for as long as possible. These can be bought online at www.inked.ae. Individuals and organisations looking to support in larger numbers can email info@inked.ae or call 050 845 1359.

5. One Donation Feeds Two with nefsy

What is it? This food app lets people who use its service give back, as well as take advantage of discounts and deals across hundreds of restaurants in Dubai. Every time you buy a meal with nefsy, a meal will be donated to someone less fortunate on your behalf. The food you buy is only available for dine-in or to takeaway, unless the restaurant offers its own delivery service.

The initiative is supported by Emirates Red Crescent, the Government of Dubai, the Islamic Affairs & Charitable Activities Department and Fund for UAE the Homeland of Humanity.

How can you donate? At the moment, every time you buy one meal with nefsy, another meal will be donated to someone in need on your behalf in the UAE, as well as a second free meal to someone in another country.

You gain ranks based on the number of meals you've purchased, and the app will tell you how many lives impacted that equates to. It provides you with a certificate with those details each month.

If you own a restaurant, you can also sign up to the initiative.

For more information, click here.

6. Companies For Good

What is it? This one is for businesses looking for a way to donate and support Dubai's most vulnerable communities, but also to engage its workforce in the process. Teams can sign up for the app and then engage in an exercise activity together in order to reach a common goal, which will then activate a charitable contribution.

How can you donate? You need to track your goal, which you can choose yourself, and then once you reach it, your contribution will be made. So, you might decide everyone will do 50,000 minutes of exercise together in one month in order to have meals or groceries donated to Dubai labourers. All you have to do is download the Veerto app and have everyone track their minutes.

It's not just food, as you can also contribute other essentials or Covid Relief Packs. It's up to you.

To get access to the app, there's a cost of Dh20 per employee every month. The contribution towards the social initiative is paid only once (not monthly) and will be based on your allocated budget.

99,abu dhabi islamic bank,23-04-2020,"Sharjah-based Dana Gas reiterated its earlier plans to use the proceeds from the sale of its Egyptian assets to pay down its sukuk due in October, according to a bourse filing.

The company, which operates concessions in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq as well as in Egypt, already started a strategic review of its Egyptian assets and confirmed it would direct proceeds from a potential sale towards paying down its Islamic bond, Dana Gas said in a statement to the Abu Dhabi stock exchange on Thursday.

""If a sale of these assets were to go ahead the proceeds of the sale would be used to pay down the sukuk as required by the terms of the sukuk,"" Dana Gas said. ""The company will update the market in relation to further developments as and when they arise in relation to the strategic review.""

The statement reiterates Dana Gas' position in February, when it noted that it had ""received numerous bids and is finalising the technical and commercial evaluation"" of these. A decision was due to be made by the end of the first quarter.

Dana Gas secured an agreement in 2018 to restructure and refinance the company’s $700 million (Dh2.6 billion) sukuk, which had been the subject of a protracted legal dispute when it surprised creditors including investment bank Goldman Sachs and the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock by declaring its bonds non-Sharia-compliant.

A restructuring deal was agreed last year through which the company bought back $133m of sukuk. It is due to pay $397 million of outstanding sukuk in October and could also tap into its cash position to pay off its dues, Dana Gas chief executive Patrick Allman-Ward said in February.

Dana Gas reported an annual net profit of Dh575m for 2019 compared with a net loss of Dh682m in the previous year. The rise in profit was supported by higher production from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, where the company has gas assets. The company's profitability also received a boost as provisions for impairments declined and its earnings from Kurdistan and Egypt increased, offsetting the fluctuation in oil prices.

Separately, the company's shareholders gave the green light to progress a study into splitting the company into two separate entities.

A feasibility study will now be undertaken to investigate proposals announced late last month to demerge its upstream and midstream businesses, to create two publicly-traded companies on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange.

Under the plan, existing shareholders would own shares in both the upstream business, which comprises operations in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and Egypt, and a midstream business that owns a UAE Gas project that is currently under arbitration, the company said on April 22. Shareholders gave their approval for the study to go ahead, and for a 5.5 fils per share dividend to be issued, on Wednesday.","Sharjah-based Dana Gas reiterated its earlier plans to use the proceeds from the sale of its Egyptian assets to pay down its sukuk due in October, according to a bourse filing.

100,abu dhabi islamic bank,21-04-2020,"Aldar Properties is partnering with banks in Abu Dhabi to offer home finance at low interest rates at some of its developments in the capital.

The company, which is Abu Dhabi's biggest developer, is teaming up with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank to offer finance at a fixed rate of 1.99 per cent for three or five years with no application or valuation fees, Aldar said in a statement.

The offer, which is valid for 30 days, also includes three- to six-months' payment deferral when purchasing homes at developments including Yas Acres, The Bridges, Mamsha and Jawaher, according to the company.

“We remain confident and optimistic about the opportunities available within Abu Dhabi’s real estate market, and we look forward to a long and successful relationship with all of our customers for many years to come,” said Rashed Al Omaira, executive director – commercial at Aldar Properties.

Customers can also benefit from Abu Dhabi Municipality’s recent waiver of the 2 per cent property registration fees as well as a service charge waiver from Aldar for the first year, the company said.

“We are ... committed to finding new ways in which we can deliver more value to our communities – from enhancing the surrounding destinations, reducing service charges and improving service levels within the communities,” Mr Al Omaira said.

Aldar has also made virtual home tours available for its customers and is carrying out specialised disinfection services to ensure a safe handover of homes in the wake of the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic.

The Central Bank of the UAE has relaxed lending limits for mortgages in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic as part of a series of measures that includes a Dh256 billion stimulus injection into the economy.

Loan to value ratios were eased by 5 per cent, meaning the deposit required to buy a new home decreased to 20 per cent from 25 per cent for first time expatriate buyers, and to 15 per cent, from 20 per cent, for Emiratis.

Aldar last month announced its own Dh100 million commitment to support residents, customers and partners as part of Abu Dhabi's wider efforts to cushion the blow faced by the global economy due to the coronavirus. The company also set aside Dh4bn to ensure timely payment to its contractors and suppliers.

The overall economy and the real estate market are expected to face strong headwinds in the near term due to the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices, consultancy Core recently said in a report.

“While the real impact is impossible to quantify and the recovery timeline unknowable, we are seeing demand drop drastically as most organisations adjust to social and travel restrictions,” Core said.

“Limitations to physically view properties and conduct businesses are leading to extended transaction timelines; however, we expect technology to be used to connect parties and reduce some of the barriers to execution.”

Aldar reported an 81 per cent surge in fourth quarter net profit on the back of higher revenues for 2019. Net profit attributable to shareholders for the period ending December 31, climbed to Dh577m, while revenue jumped 17 per cent to Dh2.1bn.","Aldar Properties is partnering with banks in Abu Dhabi to offer home finance at low interest rates at some of its developments in the capital.

101,abu dhabi islamic bank,21-04-2020,"I was a senior executive banker in Dubai for many years until I lost my job two years ago when my role became redundant. I have been living in Pakistan since October 2018 while I am hunting relentlessly for a job anywhere in the GCC.

I have a mortgage with a foreign bank located in the UAE for a property I bought for Dh2.45 million in 2009 with a 15 per cent down payment. The monthly payment on the mortgage is Dh9,700 and I've informed the bank I am now out of the country and desperately trying to find a position back in the UAE or wider region.

The bank keeps saying the regulations state they cannot give assistance as I am a non-resident. QF, Pakistan

Until recently, the property was rented out so I was able to keep up with my monthly repayments. At first, I received Dh110,000 per year in rent but after rates dropped in Dubai it went down to between Dh65,000 to Dh70,000. I then tried to rent it out on short lets, but with the movement restrictions now in place I am unable to get any tenants at all. It is now sitting empty and my job hunt has also become harder as a result of the pandemic.

I approached the mortgage provider to ask for assistance to help me weather through this very difficult period.

The bank flatly refused stating that as a non-resident they cannot help. It keeps saying that the regulations state they cannot give assistance as I am a non-resident. Why are they isolating me and discriminating against me just because I was unemployed prior to the pandemic?

I am 50, have no other debts and now live in Pakistan with my in-laws in their house. My monthly expenses in Pakistan come to Dh20,000 and include this debt repayment. I am meeting the mortgage payment through my savings and with help from my father-in-law. I can continue to do this for another six months; after that I will need help.

My outstanding mortgage liability is Dh1.6m and the property is now only worth Dh1m to Dh1.1m, therefore selling is not an option.

Regardless of being a resident or not, I have been regular on my mortgage payments for 11 years and I am still seeking employment. Am I also not a human suffering in this crisis? How can the bank be so ruthless and not assist me? QF, Pakistan

Debt panellist 1: Philip King, head of retail banking at Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank

Long periods of unemployment can be very demotivating, but it is important to remain optimistic and continuously work towards your goal of securing a job. It is great to see your debt is contained to only one lender as opposed to several and despite your situation, you are finding ways to repay your debt in a timely manner.

Unfortunately, it could be difficult to leverage from the current Covid-19 financial relief initiatives, such as the UAE Central Bank’s Targeted Economic Support Scheme, given that it excludes outstanding loans of government, government-related entities and non-residents.

However, your lender may be understanding, given the extent of the global situation and its impact on the financial climate. In a real estate slump, many debtors can find themselves in negative equity, in which the market value of their property is less than the original principal they secured on it. That being said, it is of interest to the bank to find a mutually beneficial solution to avoid potential loan defaults. In addition, home financing is considered a secured loan, implying that the bank has the ability to provide you with a viable repayment structure.

Consider approaching your lender again and providing them with the full circumstances of your situation. Aim for a renegotiation on the current terms of your loan and see what options they are willing to provide you with, whether it is a repayment deferment or an extension of the financing tenure. Reassure them that you are consistently looking for a job, committed to continue repaying your debt on time, and that you will be providing them with the full details of your contract once your new employment commences.

We highly encourage you to continue your job hunt and to expand it beyond the GCC to garner more opportunities. Also, make a conscious effort to decrease your expenses by cutting back on unnecessary spending.

Debt panellist 2: Ambareen Musa, founder and chief executive of Souqalmal.com

The fact you haven't defaulted on your mortgage payments, definitely works in your favour. But bizarrely, this is a double-edged sword. Some banks may only be willing to renegotiate the repayment terms of a loan if a borrower defaults on the loan. Speak to your bank again and explain you are facing genuine financial hardship and cannot afford to pay your instalments anymore.

If your non-resident status still gets in the way and negotiating from overseas is an issue, consider hiring a legal representative who can speak to the bank on your behalf. Another option is to get in touch with the Embassy of Pakistan in the UAE to see if they can get you access to pro-bono legal advice before you pursue that route.

A legal expert can negotiate a restructured mortgage repayment plan and look into how the UAE's new Insolvency Law can come to your rescue. The provisions under this law also cover ex-residents like yourself, who are struggling to meet their debt commitments from overseas.

If you do decide to go down the insolvency route, your legal representative can petition the local civil court and commence insolvency proceedings on your behalf. The Insolvency Law can help you clear your debts in two ways: first, by negotiating a settlement plan with the lender under the supervision of a court-appointed mediator. If this doesn't work, then a formal bankruptcy declaration is the second option. The court will facilitate bankruptcy proceedings, where your assets (primarily your property in Dubai) will have to be liquidated to pay off the lender.

Debt panellist 3: Richard Boyd, director at Mortgage Finder

This is a tricky situation, however, there are a number of avenues to explore. The first is to get in touch with the collections department at the bank. Until now, it is likely you will have been dealing with customer service teams who are generally unable to make decisions on repayment negotiations.

The collections department has the authority to make agreements with customers on loan repayments, however you usually only reach them when you default on payments. As you have previously worked in the banking sector, ask former colleagues if they can connect you with the collections department of this lender.

Since selling the property is not ideal, reducing the repayments is the best solution to help your savings last longer. There are a number of ways to approach the bank. First, ask to switch the mortgage to interest only. This will reduce the interest rate and mean the repayments decrease as you will only need to cover the interest on the loan and not the principal amount.

The second option is to ask the bank to increase the loan tenor. Central Bank of the UAE regulations changed recently to remove the age limit cap on mortgages. So, the bank could increase the length of the loan to the maximum of 25 years, which reduces your monthly repayments as they are spread over a longer period of time.

Alternatively, ask the bank for some leniency, given the pandemic, to allow you the three-month payment holiday even though you are an overseas resident.

I strongly recommend investigating long-term rental options. It may mean taking a lower income, but this will help with repayments and there are many real estate agents that can assist remotely.

The last suggestion, if all else fails, would be to put the property on the market to sell. However, negotiate with the bank first to ensure they agree to write off part of the loan once the property is sold. We have seen some lenders agree to this in the past.

102,abu dhabi islamic bank,20-04-2020,"The number of economic incentives by UAE federal and emirate governments to help the national economy deal with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic have exceeded 100 in a span of just 45 days, according to the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority.

The measures range from subsidised utility bills to government fee waivers and rent concessions aimed at helping individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) withstand fluctuations in economic conditions.

They will start showing “positive outcomes during the second quarter of 2020”, the authority said in a statement carried by the state news agency Wam on Monday.

The UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, was the first in the region to roll out Dh282bn in fiscal and monetary support, including a Dh256bn package for banks that provided zero-interest funding and freed up capital to boost lending growth in the country.

The Abu Dhabi government launched its own package of financial incentives in coordination with local banks and the emirate’s departments of Finance and Economic Development. The measures aim to provide individuals and SMEs with immediate support and reduce financing costs.

The Department of Finance earlier this week partnered with First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank to expand its SME Credit Guarantee Scheme. The government is guaranteeing up to 80 per cent of the value of loans extended to SMEs, a move that allows access to renewable financing options for working capital and term loans.

Other support measures in Abu Dhabi include Dh5bn to subsidise utility bills, Dh1bn for a new market making fund at the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, deferring loans for three months, and halting evictions due to non-payment of rents.

In Dubai, the government has introduced economic incentives worth Dh1.5bn for three months and directed local banks to provide a comprehensive support package to clients affected by the pandemic.

In addition, the authorities pledged state aid for Emirates airline, reduced utility bills by 10 per cent for three months, and discounted insurance premiums by 50 per cent, and provided a package of measures for companies based in free zones.

Authorities in Sharjah have also launched measures to help some of the hardest hit sectors of its economy. In tourism, the emirate has exempted hotels from municipality fees for three months, reduced fees for various exhibitions and events in 2020 and granted a 50 per cent discount for shops and commercial centres participating in marketing campaigns. It has also allowed a 50 per cent rental reduction for three months for restaurants, currency exchanges, shops, banks, travel agencies, communication stores and car rental companies inside airports.

The governments of Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah, Umm Al Qaiwain and Fujairah have followed economic measures adopted by the federal government and implemented a series of initiatives that include cuts in government fees, exemptions from rental payments and licence renewal fees and reductions in traffic fines.","The number of economic incentives by UAE federal and emirate governments to help the national economy deal with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic have exceeded 100 in a span of just 45 days, according to the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority.

103,abu dhabi islamic bank,19-04-2020,"UAE lenders have tapped 30 per cent of a Dh50 billion Targeted Economic Support Scheme (Tess) facility to help businesses and individuals through the Covid-19 outbreak, the Central Bank of the UAE said on Sunday.

Lenders ""are passing on these funds to their customers affected by the Covid-19 pandemic"", Governor Abdulhamid Saeed said.

""We will continue to work closely with banks and financial institutions to accelerate their full utilisation of the Tess,"" Mr Saeed said.

""This requires banks to closely collaborate with us and intensify their efforts to implement the economic stimulus package for the benefit of the banking sector and the UAE economy.”

The support scheme was announced as a Dh100 billion package on March 14, which included a direct Dh50bn injection of funds through zero cost collateralised loans provided by the central bank, plus a relaxation of banks' capital buffers allowing them to increase lending by another Dh50bn.

Further easing of restrictions on capital and liquidity reserves subsequently increased the overall size of the stimulus to Dh256bn.

The central bank also reiterated that lenders remove requirements for small and medium-sized businesses to have a minimum account balance of Dh10,000 before opening accounts.

The regulator also said lenders should speed up the length of time it took to open accounts to no longer than two days – unless potential customers were deemed to be high-risk under anti money-laundering rules.

The central bank said it expected banks to ""retain sound lending standards"" and treat customers fairly, but added that all banks should participate in the scheme, which is set to run until the end of this year. It also said it will begin to publish details of how individual banks have used the Tess facility, starting next month.

The Covid-19 outbreak represents the biggest challenge to the global economy since the Great Depression of the 1930s, as social distancing measures put in to limit its spread hit industries such as aviation and tourism hard.

Last week, the International Monetary Fund said it expected the global economy to shrink 3 per cent in 2020, a sharp downward revision from its earlier forecast of 3.3 per cent growth. Lower oil prices also mean Middle East and Central Asia economies were projected to contract 2.8 per cent this year.

Banks in Abu Dhabi were undertaking 17 initiatives to help customers affected by Covid-19, such as payment holidays for up to three months on mortgages, personal loans and credit card debts for individuals, and three-month holidays on business loans (with no extra charges) for SMEs.

Abu Dhabi, home to about 6 per cent of the world’s proven oil reserves, has enough assets to ""safeguard economic growth in the long-run"", he said. This includes the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Mubadala Investment Company, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ).

“I can confidently say that we are well cushioned,” he told The National. “Abu Dhabi’s resilient economy is the product of decades of fiscal prudence. Over the past decades, time-and-time again, we have proven that we can withstand global macroeconomic headwinds.”

Abu Dhabi's net asset position exceeds 250 per cent of its gross domestic product, S&P Global Rating said in March, when it affirmed the emirate's ""AA/A-1+"" rating.

Maintaining a resilient balance sheet, through sustainable returns on assets and optimising spending while sustaining budgetary discipline is the top priority for the finance department, he said.

“Like everyone else in these times, as a precautionary measure we are looking at our spending, but our focus is on rationalising in areas that do not impact the economic climate,” Mr Al Zaabi said.

“Our forward-looking debt management strategy is also a crucial pillar of the fiscal plan, and we will continue to evaluate options under the funding sources available to us.”

The global economy is facing its deepest recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s and is projected to shrink 3 per cent in 2020, the International Monetary Fund said earlier this month. The bleak forecast from the Washington-based lender is a more than 6 percentage point revision, relative to its October 2019 estimates and updated January 2020 projections of a 3.3 per cent expansion in global gross domestic product. The outlook now is worse than the 2008 financial crisis and the IMF does not expect recovery to take place before 2021.

Governments and central banks across the globe have poured an estimated $8 trillion (Dh29.4tn) into the global economy to ensure financial stability and soften the impact of the outbreak. Oil prices have declined more than 50 per cent since the beginning of this year, which has added to economic woes globally.

To mitigate the impact on its economy, the UAE was the first in the Middle East and North Africa to roll out Dh282 billion in fiscal and monetary support, providing zero interest funding to banks to boost lending growth in the country. The government, in addition, has implemented a variety of other initiatives that range from discounted utility bills to waivers of fees to buttress the economy.

The emirate’s Department of Finance last week partnered with First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank to expand its SME Credit Guarantee Scheme, as it looks to help smaller business withstand economic fluctuations.

The government is guaranteeing up to 80 per cent of the value of loans extended to SMEs. The move allows access to renewable financing options for working capital for a three-month period and term loans of up to four years.

“We remain firmly focused on further accelerating the development of our thriving non-hydrocarbon sector,” Mr Al Zaabi said. “The stimulus packages launched by the government of Abu Dhabi and the Central Bank of the UAE have created optimal conditions for companies to weather the current conditions.”

One of those measures, a Dh50bn support facility for banks to help businesses and individuals through the Covid-19 outbreak has already been 30 per cent utilised, the Central Bank of the UAE said on Sunday.

The funds raised from the bonds will help with Abu Dhabi's plans to offset the decline in revenue from lower oil prices. The bonds were issued as part of its debt management strategy to help the emirate diversify its funding options.

“We will continue to evaluate options under the existing issuance programme,” Mr Al Zaabi noted.","Abu Dhabi’s economy is ""well cushioned"" from external shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic and volatility in oil markets, the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Finance said on Sunday.

105,abu dhabi islamic bank,17-04-2020,"BR Shetty, the founder of NMC Health, which was placed into administration by a UK court last week and faces criminal charges, said he flew to India in early February for personal reasons.

Mr Shetty told The National when reached by phone on Friday that he left the UAE to Mangalore on February 7 to be with his brother, who had cancer and died earlier this month aged 82.

“He was sick. That’s why I came in February and he was sick for two months and he died maybe a fortnight back,” Mr Shetty said.

“Once the coronavirus restrictions are over and flights are open, I’ll come” back to the UAE, he said. He is with his wife, while the rest of his family remains in Abu Dhabi, he added.

Reports had suggested Mr Shetty fled to India as legal and operational challenges mounted in relation to his companies NMC Health and Finablr, both listed on the London Stock Exchange.

Mr Shetty said he has “kept quiet” about the allegations he and his companies are facing, and “didn’t want to react, because I don’t know the facts, I don’t know what happened”.

In a statement to The National, Mr Shetty said: “Given my own legal and forensic investigations are now starting to produce some initial findings, and in consideration of some of the misleading and false allegations that have made against me, I will be looking to respond in the appropriate manner and with the appropriate authorities both in the UAE and elsewhere … I am absolutely determined to bring to light the full facts, and the whole truth, around what has transpired as soon as possible.”

Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank has initiated criminal legal proceedings with the attorney general in Abu Dhabi against a number of individuals linked to NMC Health.

“This action is consistent with the bank’s objective to protect its interests,"" the lender said in a statement on Wednesday.

The bank, which is the embattled hospital operator's biggest sole creditor with an exposure of $981 million, did not specify who it had initiated criminal proceedings against.

A UK court placed NMC Health into administration on the application of ADCB last week.

Overall, UAE banks have a combined exposure of at least Dh8bn to the healthcare firm. Other significant creditors include Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, Barclays and Standard Chartered. NMC also owes money to Oman-based banks and financial institutions.

The latest development comes as joint administrators Alvarez & Marsal appointed four new non-executive directors ""to ensure more robust standards of governance"" at the firm.

More than 80 major local, regional and international financial institutions extended credit to NMC, which was founded by Mr Shetty in Abu Dhabi in 1975, and now employs more than 2,000 doctors and about 20,000 other staff in 19 countries.

The company has made a series of damaging disclosures in the past few months after a report by activist investor Muddy Waters in December alleged it inflated cash balances, overpaid for assets and understated its debt.

Last month, NMC revealed its debt stood at $6.6bn, substantially higher than the $2.1bn declared in its last filed accounts. A review committee also discovered evidence of “suspected fraudulent behaviour”.

In February, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority launched an investigation into NMC's activities after the company's shares were suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange.

NMC Health appointed Ithmar Capital’s managing partner, Faisal Belhoul, as executive chairman on March 26 after the Dubai private equity firm took a 9 per cent stake in the healthcare company.

Mr Shetty's financial services holding company Finablr is also facing challenges. Last month, the company cited a number of issues affecting its business, including travel restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus, the recent credit downgrade of Travelex’s bonds and a liquidity squeeze. It announced a potential insolvency appointment and the UAE Central Bank subsequently intervened to oversee Finablr’s UAE Exchange business.

Mr Shetty resigned as NMC chairman in February and from Finablr unit Travelex's board in March. The 77-year-old has a net worth of $3.15bn, according to Forbes.","That’s why I came in February and he was sick for two months and he died maybe a fortnight back,” Mr Shetty said.

106,abu dhabi islamic bank,16-04-2020,"Abu Dhabi’s department of finance has joined hands with three of the emirate’s top lenders to expand the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme, as it looks to soften the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on smaller business.

Under the deal with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and the country's biggest lender First Abu Dhabi Bank, the government will guarantee up to 80 per cent of the value of the scheme extended to small and medium-sized businesses, it said in a statement on Thursday. The move is aimed at “bolstering businesses’ resilience” to withstand market fluctuations, it added.

The pact provides SMEs with wider access to renewable financing options for working capital loans for a three-month duration and term loans for a up to four-year duration to support further investment in Abu Dhabi.

“The scheme is available to all SMEs that are registered, operating and headquartered in the emirate,” the statement said.

SMEs are a key component of Abu Dhabi’s business landscape, accounting for 98 per cent of all companies in the emirate, 29 per cent of its GDP, and 44 per cent of the non-oil economy.

“Providing this significant sector with more financing options during this period creates invaluable long-term economic returns and ensures a sustainable and robust path towards Abu Dhabi’s knowledge-based, diversified economy,” the statement added.

The new partnership is part of Abu Dhabi’s economic stimulus package announced last month. The economic relief scheme includes 16 initiatives aimed at reducing the costs of living and supporting businesses in the emirate.

The UAE, the second-biggest Arab economy, was the first in the Middle East and North Africa to roll out Dh282bn in fiscal and monetary support, providing zero interest funding to banks to boost lending growth in the country. The government, in addition, has also implemented a variety of other initiatives that range from discounted utility bills to waivers of fees to buttress the economy.

Lenders in the UAE have already rolled out a comprehensive package to reduce financial distress of their clientele. Banking benefits packages extend relief to businesses and individuals, particularly in stressed sectors, through reduced costs and fees, loan deferrals, reduced interest rates and processing fees.

Earlier this month, the UAE Central Bank also urged lenders to support the private sector and individual borrowers to cushion the impact of Covid-19 and disbursed Dh10bn worth of zero interest loans to banks from the Targeted Economic Support Scheme launched in March.","Abu Dhabi’s department of finance has joined hands with three of the emirate’s top lenders to expand the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme, as it looks to soften the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on smaller business.

107,abu dhabi islamic bank,15-04-2020,"Iftar meals will be directly delivered to those in need in the UAE this year, rather than being served at Ramadan tents or at mosques.

The change in delivery approach was made necessary to avoid crowding in areas, which is banned as part of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus.

On Wednesday, charity organisations said food parcels containing essential groceries – including rice, sugar, flour and canned goods - would be delivered to anyone struggling to feed themselves or their families this year.

Many people around the world have taken a financial hit this year, having had their salaries slashed or been asked to go on an early or unpaid leave. Some have also been let go by companies struggling to mitigate financial losses as a result of the pandemic.

In the past, there were many Ramadan tents set up to provide food and in mosques but now, with the current situation, it is not safe to set them up and they won’t be there any more Shukoor Kallungal, Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre

This year, charities in the UAE have found new ways to help those in need without resorting to large gatherings at mosques.

These parcels will be delivered to homes instead. This is the first time Ramadan tents that fed the low-income workers is being abandoned since the formation of the UAE.

Dar Al Ber Society told The National it would provide 11,000 meals to people in Ras Al Khaimah, Ajman and Dubai this year.

“We are expecting a lot more since hotels too will have to donate through a charity,"" said Dr Hisham Al Zahrany, deputy director of Social Services at the society.

""The target is labour accommodation where a representative will go in and deliver the meals. And then there are those whose jobs have been affected by the curfews and the pandemic such as taxi drivers,” he said.

Shukoor Kallungal, president of Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre in Abu Dhabi, said they are expecting to distribute more than 700 food bags a day during Ramadan.

""With the current situation, it is not possible to make iftar meals, but we will be distributing groceries for the people [in need] to prepare food at home.""

The centre is already distributing between 600 to 700 meals a day to low-income workers.

""We started 10 days ago, since the coronavirus difficulties started. Many people are sitting in their rooms without any salary or income, so we are trying to help them,"" he said.

The centre receives requests for food through their helpline. They began by distributing ready meals, but switched to groceries - with each bag containing basic foodstuff such as rice, chicken and eggs.

""We are trying to reduce cooked food meals and switch to groceries, to reduce social contact,"" he said.

""In Ramadan it is going to be very necessary to increase food bags. In the past, there were many Ramadan tents set up to provide food and in mosques but now, with the current situation, it is not safe to set them up and they won’t be there any more.

""We are expecting a requirement for more than 700 [food bags] a day,” he said.

On Wednesday, Emirates Red Crescent said it aims to help more than one million people through its charitable initiatives this Ramadan.

Their annual campaign would usually involve providing iftar meals to those in need at Ramadan tents set up across the country.

This year, the organisation will also be delivering food parcels to people to avoid crowding and adhere to social-distancing rules.

Other ERC programmes include Zakat Al Fitr, a charity undertaken at the end of Ramadan, and handing out clothes to those in need ahead of Eid Al Fitr - when Muslims typically wear new clothes to celebrate the ""festival of breaking the fast"".

Beneficiaries of this year's campaign will include members of vulnerable families and workers, reported state news agency Wam.

Sponsors of the campaign include Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, and Etisalat.

""We are preparing to start the best month of the year by strengthening the spirit of human solidarity and offering the opportunity to participate in our programmes around the country, which will benefit hundreds of thousands,"" said Rashid Al Mansouri, ERC deputy secretary-general for Local Affairs.","Iftar meals will be directly delivered to those in need in the UAE this year, rather than being served at Ramadan tents or at mosques.
