The rupee depreciated by 25 paise to 76.31 against the US dollar to quote at Dh20.79 in opening trade on Friday, tracking weak domestic equities and strengthening of the US dollar overseas.
Forex traders said the rupee opened on a weak note taking negative cues from Asian equities.
The rupee opened at 76.30 at the interbank forex market and then fell further to 76.31, down 25 paise over its last close.
The dollar stands near a two-and-a-half week high against a basket of currencies and is 0.9 per cent stronger for the week.
Both had rallied through those levels overnight as markets shrugged off dire economic news in Europe and the United States and commodity prices forged ahead.
