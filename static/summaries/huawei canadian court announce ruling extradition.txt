On Wednesday, the Supreme Court of British Columbia is set to release a decision on whether Meng Wanzhou’s case meets a key threshold of Canada’s extradition law.
If associate chief justice Heather Holmes rules that it fails to meet that test, Ms Meng could be released from house arrest in Vancouver.
ReutersThe pursuit of Ms Meng by US authorities predates the Trump administration: officials were building a case against her since at least 2013, according to court documents.
Had Ms Meng’s alleged conduct taken place in Canada, the transactions by HSBC wouldn’t violate any Canadian sanctions, they say.
If the ruling goes against her, Ms Meng’s next court hearings are scheduled for June and are set to continue to at least the end of the year.
