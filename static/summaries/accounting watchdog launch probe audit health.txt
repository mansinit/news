The regulatory body for accountancy practices in the UK, the Financial Reporting Council, is investigating EY's 2018 audit of NMC Health, the UAE's biggest private healthcare company that was placed into administration last month.
The investigation will be conducted by the FRCâ€™s Enforcement Division under the Audit Enforcement Procedure.
The UK's Financial Conduct Authority announced its own investigation into the company in the same month.
NMC Health was placed into administration last month following a petition from its largest lender, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, but its hospitals, clinics and pharmacies are continuing to operate.
Last month ADCB said it "initiated criminal legal proceeding with the Attorney General in Abu Dhabi against a number of individuals in relation to NMC Health Group".
