Commercial Bank of Dubai, which counts Investment Corporation of Dubai as its biggest shareholder, became the latest lender in the UAE to allow foreign ownership of its shares, as it looks to broaden its investor base.
"The bank has received substantial interest from foreign investors, which was the main driver for us setting the FOL at the level announced today," said Bernd van Linder, chief executive of Commercial Bank of Dubai.
Earlier this year, Dubai Islamic Bank and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, raised their foreign ownership limit to 40 per cent from 25 per cent after obtaining approval from their shareholders in March.
The new foreign ownership limit will come into effect starting on June 14, the bank said.
Commercial Bank of Dubai reported a 7 per cent slide in the first quarter this year, as impairment allowances rose and revenue fell amid the coronavirus pandemic.
