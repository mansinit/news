Some of the biggest banks in the UK have scrapped billions of pounds in shareholder dividends and share buy-backs after the Bank of England said holding on to cash would help lessen the financial fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered have all stopped payouts.
The regulator said that the banks had enough money in reserve to cope with a global recession and a shock in financial markets.
Bank shares fell on Wednesday on London's benchmark FTSE 100 index, which sank 3.7 per cent overall in early afternoon trading.
​Barclays shares were trading 7.6 per cent lower at £86.98 and HSBC shares were down 9.2 per cent at £412.70 by 2.10pm UK time.
