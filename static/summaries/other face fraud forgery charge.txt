Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, which has the largest exposure of Dh3 billion to NMC Healthcare, has filed a criminal complaint, alleging "fraud and forgery" against six people, including founder BR Shetty, and former CEO Prasnath Manghat, linked to the embattled group.
ADCB said it was "acting on its own behalf and on behalf of its subsidiary Al Hilal Bank and its acquired bank United National Bank".
The charges levelled against the accused include forgery of financial records and fraud.
Abdulaziz Al Ghurair, chairman of the UAE Banks Federation, has said what happened with NMC "is a world-class fraud, and the management and board members should be held accountable."
Since December 2019, after the US short-seller Muddy Waters questioned its financial irregularities, NMC share value had shrunk by more 70 per cent.
