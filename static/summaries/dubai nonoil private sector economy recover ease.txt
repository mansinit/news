Dubai's non-oil private sector economy improved in May to hit its highest level in three months as the emirate eased restrictions to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
“Overall, the May PMI data indicates a contraction in Dubai’s private sector in the [second quarter], although the indices appear to have bottomed [out],” Khatija Haque, head of Mena research at Emirates NBD, said in a note on Monday.
Public and private sector employees are returning to work in phases, while malls and other private sector businesses have reopened.
Last week, Dubai, the commercial and trading hub of the Middle East, allowed malls and private sector companies to operate at 100 per cent capacity.
Expectations about business activity in Dubai’s non-oil economy in the next 12 months also ticked up in May, from a record low in April.
