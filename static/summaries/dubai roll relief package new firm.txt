The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), regulator of Dubai’s onshore financial hub, on Tuesday rolled out a relief package for firms based in the Dubai International Financial Centre that includes fee waivers and reduced capital requirements.
These initiatives will reduce financial stress on new and existing firms, allowing them to cope with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the DFSA said in a statement.
Existing authorised firms in the DIFC will receive fee waivers for applications relating to “authorised individuals”.
DIFC companies will also get an extension of time to file various returns and reports, including their annual report of the Sharia supervisory board, where applicable.
The DIFC is home to some of the world’s biggest financial institutions, banks, investment firms, wealth managers and insurers.
