The Central Bank of the UAE issued guidance to financial institutions on the application of International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9) to ensure that credit losses due to Covid-19 are appropriately calculated.
The guidance for complying with IFRS 9 – a global accounting standard applied to financial instruments – was issued after a consultation with stakeholders, the central bank said in a statement on Saturday.
The guidance also aims to “ensure transparency and disclosure, contributing to strengthened financial stability in the UAE”, the central bank said.
For the first group facing temporary liquidity issues, the regulators said banks should not reclassify loans as problem loans during the Tess period.
For the second group, companies facing a “sufficient deterioration in credit risk” should have their borrowings migrated to the second stage and classified as problem loans.
