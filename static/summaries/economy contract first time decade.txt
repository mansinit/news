Coronavirus pushed China’s economy into its first contraction in decades in the first quarter, as weak consumer spending and production point to a long, hard recovery.
China’s economy hasn’t contracted on a full-year basis since the end of the Mao era in the 1970s.
The economy was forced into a paralysis in late January as the epidemic that first started in Wuhan spread across the country.
The economy remained shuttered for much of February with factories and shops closed and workers stranded at home.
Consumer caution “continues to restrain demand, and thus activity more broadly,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asia economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong.
