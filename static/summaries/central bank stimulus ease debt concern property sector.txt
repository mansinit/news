Measures by the Central Bank of the UAE designed to help borrowers offset the effects of the coronavirus pandemic will help residents meet their debt repayments and boost the countryâ€™s property sector, according to analysts.
"With the full impact of the coronavirus on the global economy still unknown it is particularly encouraging to see such positive action from the Central Bank of the UAE," Abdulfattah Sharaf, UAE chief executive and head of international, HSBC Bank Middle East, told The National.
The bank is also donating 0.5 per cent of its debit card spends in March to support the fight against Covid-19.
A separate measure from the central bank increased loan-to-value ratios applicable on mortgage loans for first-time buyers by 5 percentage points.
"Either way, it should be a shot in the arm for the property market, especially the secondary market," he added.
