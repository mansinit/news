The Dubai Financial Market, the only listed bourse in the GCC, on Wednesday launched the UAE Index for environment, social and governance (ESG), the first benchmark of its kind in the region that will gauge how responsible listed firms in the country are.
The S&P and Hawkamah UAE ESG index initially includes 20 listed companies and is based on five years of past performance.
“The index provides a trusted and transparent tool that measures listed companies’ commitment to ESG,” Essa Kazim, chairman of the DFM, said.
Money managers across the world have faced criticism for not addressing climate change in their investment practices.
“The [DFM's] new ESG index will create good competition between listed companies to do the right thing, paying more attention to the environment, social and governance elements when managing their business.”
