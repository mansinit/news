HSBC Bank Oman disclosed an exposure of about $16 million (Dh58.76m) to embattled UAE healthcare firm NMC Health.
Dubai’s biggest lender, Emirates NBD, and a number of other banks including Dubai Islamic Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, Commercial Bank International, National Bank of Fujairah and RAK Bank, among others, extended financing to NMC.
Dubai Islamic Bank said it is owed $425m by NMC, and that Noor Bank, which it acquired in January, is owed $116m.
Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank is owed $291.4m, and has a $31m investment in an NMC Health sukuk.
Dubai’s biggest lender, Emirates NBD, is owed Dh747.3m – most of which is due to Emirates Islamic Bank, the bank said last week.
