China’s industrial output increased in April for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak, adding to early signs of a recovery that economists cautioned would be slow and challenging.
Industrial output rose 3.9 per cent from a year earlier, reversing a drop of 1.1 per cent in March, data showed on Friday.
The surveyed urban jobless rate, which doesn’t include all of the workforce, rose to 6 per cent, from March’s 5.9 per cent.
The industrial improvement signalled that government stimulus efforts are having some effect, although support remains modest compared with China’s global peers.
Private firms’ industrial output rose 7 per cent in April, faster than other types of enterprises including state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and foreign companies, according to the statement.
