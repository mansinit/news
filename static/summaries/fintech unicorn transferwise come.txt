Customers in the UAE with a bank account can verify their identification and register for TransferWise online.
The “UAE is considered one of the cheapest in charges worldwide,” Mr Al Rahma said.
“Globally we’re able to deliver 25 per cent of our payments in 20 seconds,” Mr Kaarmann said.
Mr Kaarmann said TransferWise is “excited to be working with [ADGM] as a local partner”, bringing “innovation on the ground to the UAE”.
“We’re just getting going here, so we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves too much,” Mr Kaarmann said.
