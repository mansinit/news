UAE banks have started reporting their exposure to the Dubai subsidiary of Phoenix Commodities, which recently filed for liquidation.
Emirates NBD and Mashreq both declared exposure to the company on Tuesday in regulatory filings to the Dubai Financial Market.
Emirates NBD said it is owed $23.66 million (Dh86.8m) by Phoenix Global DMCC (PGD), a Dubai-based, wholly-owned subsidiary of British Virgin Islands-registered Phoenix Commodities.
Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank and National Bank of Fujairah, said they had no exposure to the company.
The National was unable to reach anyone at Phoenix Global or its chairman and chief executive, Gaurav Dhawan.
