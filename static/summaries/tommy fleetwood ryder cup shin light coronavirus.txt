Tommy Fleetwood says he wants the Ryder Cup to be a "shining light" when sports finally returns after the coronavirus.
Last week, the two-time Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship winner said the Ryder Cup should be postponed until 2021, with the coronavirus pandemic making qualifying for the biennial contest unfair.
The Englishman is well placed to feature in Padraig Harrington's team this year, should the Ryder Cup go ahead as planned, sitting fifth in qualifying.
The Ryder Cup is an event people dream about and sometimes it can only happen once."
"I think there are five events really, the majors and the Ryder Cup, whatever happens it is going to work around those events I would guess," Fleetwood said.
