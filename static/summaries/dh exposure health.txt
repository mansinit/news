ADCB is among over 80 major local, regional and international financial institutions that extended credit to the NMC Health Group.
Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) Group on Thursday said it has around $981 million (Dh3.6 billion) exposure to troubled NMC Health Group and is deeply concerned about undisclosed liabilities.
"The bank is not in a position to quantify anticipated impairments at this time due to rapidly evolving developments at the NMC Health Group.
The company has piled up to $6.6 billion (Dh24.2 billion) in debt, which is higher than previously estimated $5 billion (Dh18.35 billion).
On Wednesday, Dubai-based developer Union Properties rejected rumours that it has exposure to NMC Health and dubbed the rumours as "false".
