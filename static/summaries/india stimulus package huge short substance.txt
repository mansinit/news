The stimulus package announced by India's finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman over the last five days has not inspired industrialists or businessmen.
The stimulus is principally in the form of loans to farmers and small businesses.
The government had said that the stimulus of Rs20 trillion was about 10 per cent of the GDP of the country.
So, the much awaited stimulus package will not assuage the deep wounds that the Indian economy has sustained due to the lockdown and the cessation of economic activities.
The hawkers, factory workers, small traders, shopkeepers, marginal famers, etc., of India will continue to wallow in poverty and desperation.
