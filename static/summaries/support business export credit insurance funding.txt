The UAE rolled out new measures to support exporters affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Etihad Credit Insurance (ECI), a federal entity, will assist exporters and businesses facing payment and supply chain disruptions with export credit insurance and additional funding, the agency said on Sunday.
Earlier today, the UAEâ€™s Ministry of Economy also reduced fees for 94 of its services, resulting in Dh113 million worth of savings for businesses in 2020.
Fees have been reduced on a range of services linked to innovation, business, investment, production, trade as well as import and export activities.
The organisation is also offering exporters advice on finding alternative suppliers if supply chains are disrupted due to coronavirus restrictions.
