In a statement, Mr Shetty blamed the fraud on "a small group of current and former executives at these companies".
Mr Shetty also said loans, cheques and bank transfers were also fraudulently guaranteed in his name using his "forged signature" and that he "neither authorised, consented to, or had any knowledge of".
Problems with his empire first emerged in December when activist investor Muddy Waters, a short seller, issued a report saying NMC Health had inflated its cash balances, overpaid for its assets and understated its debt.
This sparked an independent investigation which found that debts at NMC Health were materially higher, at $6.6bn, than the $2.1bn previously stated in its accounts.
Joint administrators of NMC Health this week said they intend to delist the company's shares to save costs and simplify the administration process of a business whose hospitals and clinics remain operational during the Covid-19 outbreak.
