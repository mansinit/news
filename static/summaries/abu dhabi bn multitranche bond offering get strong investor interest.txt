Abu Dhabi’s $7 billion (Dh25.7bn) multi-tranche international bond offering received strong investor interest despite concerns about the global economy.
The debt profile of Abu Dhabi – rated Aa2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA/A-1+ by S&P – continues to be prudent, underscored by low direct government debt.
Our debt management strategy is a vital component of Abu Dhabi’s economic development and supports the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030,” he said.
Despite a challenging global economic backdrop, Abu Dhabi remains the highest priced sovereign from the region, according to the Department of Finance.
BofA Securities, Citi, First Abu Dhabi Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan and Standard Chartered Bank were the joint lead-managers and bookrunners on the deal.
