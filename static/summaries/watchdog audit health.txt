On April 15, 2020 the Financial Reporting Council opened an investigation into the audit by Ernst and Young.
Britain's accounting regulator said it has opened an investigation into EY's audit of NMC Health, the troubled hospital operator that was placed into administration in April.
"On April 15, 2020 the Financial Reporting Council opened an investigation into the audit by Ernst and Young LLP of the financial statements of NMC Health for the year ended 31 December 2018," the FRC said in a statement on Monday.
EY said it has been notified of the FRC's intention to conduct an investigation into the audit of NMC Health plc.
The founder of NMC Health, BR Shetty, said on April 29 that a probe conducted by his own advisors has found alleged fraud at the firm and that he was working to clear his name.
