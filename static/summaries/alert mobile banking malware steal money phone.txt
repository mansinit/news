The malware largely targets financial applications.
An Android mobile banking malware called "EventBot" which steals user data from financial applications is spreading, warns the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).
This mobile banking Trojan abuses Android's in-built accessibility features to steal user data, read user SMS messages and intercept SMS messages, allowing malware to bypass two-factor authentication, the cybersecurity agency said in its advisory this month.
EventBot targets over 200 different financial applications, including banking applications, money-transfer services, and cryptocurrency wallets, or financial applications based in the US and Europe region at the moment but some of their services may affect Indian users as well.
The malware largely targets financial applications like Paypal Business, Revolut, Barclays, UniCredit, CapitalOne UK, HSBC UK, TransferWise, Coinbase, paysafecard etc., said CERT-In.
