HSBC on Tuesday said first quarter pre-tax profits almost halved as the banking giant is battered by the global coronavirus pandemic while it embarks on a major restructuring.
The lender reported pre-tax profits of $3.2 billion, down 48 percent from the same period in 2019, citing credit losses from clients hit by the economic slowdown as a major cause.
Banks are being hammered by market volatility and the economic slowdown caused by the virus crisis.
Before the coronavirus went global the bank announced plans to make $4.5 billion in cost cuts by 2022, with restructuring costs of around $6 billion.
The restructuring plans are the most ambitious since 2012 when HSBC was caught up in a Mexican money laundering scandal.
