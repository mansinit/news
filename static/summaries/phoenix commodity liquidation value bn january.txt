Phoenix Commodities, the trading and distribution group that was placed into liquidation last month with debts of more than $400 million (Dh1.47 billion), was valued at $1.1bn-$1.24bn as recently as January, according to a document filed by its provisional liquidators.
The valuation, provided by Deloitte India based on the company's June 2019 accounts, show the speed at which currency trading losses incurred by the company's financial derivatives desk in Dubai led to its decline.
Phoenix Commodities began as a rice trading business in 2001.
Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, the authority responsible for the free zone from which Phoenix Global traded, declined to comment.
Thus far, three banks in the UAE – First Abu Dhabi Bank, Emirates NBD and Mashreq – have reported exposure to Phoenix Commodities and its subsidiaries totalling $108.6m.
