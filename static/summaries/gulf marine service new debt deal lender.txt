Gulf Marine Services, the Abu Dhabi-based offshore services company, reached an agreement with a consortium of six lenders to restructure its debt.
The agreement will allow the company to renew existing term loans until 2025 and provides $50m (Dh183.6m) in working capital to help fund its operations.
“It’s an inflection point for GMS after many months of uncertainty,” the company’s executive chairman, Tim Summers, told The National.
The company is now targeting completion of all of the legal documentation with its banks – HSBC, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank, National Bank of Kuwait and Arab Banking Corporation – by the end of July.
The debt restructuring also provides an incentive for GMS to de-lever ahead of a capital-raising exercise to provide a new injection of equity funding.
