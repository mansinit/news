Dubai’s Tabreed bought a majority stake in Emaar Properties’ Downtown Dubai district cooling business for Dh2.48 billion on Monday and said it is looking at new opportunities in its core markets to boost growth.
The utility scheme currently provides 150,000 RT of contracted capacity through a network that distributes chilled water produced through three interconnected district cooling plants.
"With it, Tabreed becomes the second-largest district cooling player in Dubai, with an estimated 18 per cent market share."
In January, the company bought cooling plants in Masdar City and said it will explore the development of large-scale cooling plants in Sharjah through a venture with environmental management company Bee'ah.
Tabreed is also consolidating a number of service offerings to set up a new entity, Tabreed Energy Services, offering consultancy services, as well as operation and maintenance services for cooling plants.
