The most successful coach in sevens history may be absent from this year's Dubai Rugby Sevens for the first time in 25 years, after Gordon Tietjens stepped down as Samoa coach.
New Zealand won the series 12 times during Tietjens spell in charge of the team, which lasted between 1994 and 2016.
Even though he was officially on gardening leave when the 2016-17 World Sevens Series began in Dubai, he still attended that competition.
“[Tietjens] will not be renewing his contract with Samoa Rugby Union when it expires at the end of August 2020,” the Samoan union said in a statement.
“With so much uncertainty as to when the HSBC World Sevens would continue, the best solution would be to step down to allow Samoa Rugby to plan for the future,” Tietjens said.
