The syndicated loan would comprise 2.4 billion euros from German public lender KfW, with a further 600 million coming from Adidas' partner banks including HSBC, UniCredit and Deutsche Bank, the company said.
Tourism giant TUI sealed a similar, 1.8 billion euro KfW loan last week.
"The further development of the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on the company's business cannot be predicted at this point in time," Adidas said Tuesday.
The German government has promised "unlimited" credit to help companies weather the coronavirus storm.
Yet Adidas has also recently been accused of abusing coronavirus measures designed to help smaller businesses.
