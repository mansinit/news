Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC has more than $1 billion of exposure to troubled hospital operator NMC Health Plc, potentially putting one of the Middle East’s biggest financial institutions on the hook for losses on the debt, people familiar with the matter said.
NMC said this month it found evidence of suspected fraud and debt that had been used for unknown purposes.
Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank announced this month that Chairman Eissa Al Suwaidi, who oversaw last year’s three-way merger with Union National Bank and Al Hilal Bank, would step down from the board.
He was replaced by Khaldoon Al Mubarak, the group chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co.
NMC shares have been suspended since February, and the company was removed from the UK benchmark index this month.
