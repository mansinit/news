NMC Health's new executive chairman Faisal Belhoul urged the company's creditors to give him time to steer the company out of trouble as its biggest lender, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, seeks to appoint administrators.
ADCB on Saturday said it approached the High Court in the UK for administrators to be appointed to NMC Health to "safeguard the future" of the company.
"However, NMC Health failed to respond adequately to these reasonable requests from ADCB," the lender said, leading it to seek the appointment of administrators.
NMC Health had already hired a number of advisors prior to the appoint of new chairman.
It said NMC Health has exposure to over 80 major local, regional and international financial institutions.
