Parents and schools in Abu Dhabi have said a new relief fund to support struggling families will ensure children do not miss out on crucial learning.
Families can apply to receive financial support to pay school fees, ask for devices to help children with distance learning, and money to pay for food and rent.
Muneer Ansari, director at the International Indian School in Abu Dhabi, said 12 families had signed up to the initiative since Monday.
"This initiative is targeted specifically for those who are vulnerable and cannot afford to pay fees."
He believes the fund will be of great help to families whose situations will only worsen as global lockdowns continue.
