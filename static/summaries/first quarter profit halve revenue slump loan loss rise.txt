HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, warned of a further decline in earnings and a rise in loan losses as the lender set aside $3 billion (Dh11bn) for bad debts after its first quarter profit almost halved amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Higher than expected loan losses and lower revenue dragged down the quarterly profitability, the bank said in a statement on Tuesday.
Reported revenue declined 5 per cent to $13.7bn, partly impacted by adverse valuation adjustments in its global banking and markets business.
Loan losses this year could swell to between $7bn and $11bn, “depending on sensitivity analysis”, it noted.
The International Monetary Fund earlier this month projected a 3 per cent contraction in global output for 2020, noting the global economic outlook this year is worse than the 2008 global economic crisis.
