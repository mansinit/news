He also said that he did not consent to or had knowledge of the fraudulent creation and operating of bank accounts in his name.
BR Shetty, founder of the scandal-hit NMC Healthcare and Finablr, on Wednesday lashed out against "a small group of current and former executives" at those entities, accusing them of fraud subsequent to "a forensic enquiry" he had initiated.
"This fraud also appears to have been undertaken by a small group of current and former executives at these companies," Shetty said.
UAE banks said in stock exchange filings in the past few weeks they had more than Dh10 billion in exposure to NMC.
Shetty claimed that his probe revealed "the fraudulent creation and operating of bank accounts in my name including many fraudulent transfers that I neither authorised, consented to, nor had any knowledge of."
