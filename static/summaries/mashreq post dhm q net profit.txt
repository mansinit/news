Mashreq, one of the leading banks in the UAE, reported on Thursday a Dh450 million net profit for the first quarter 2020 has reported its financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2020.
In a statement, the bank said operating income for the quarter stood at Dh1.5 billion, a slight decline compared to last year.
Ahmed Abdelaal, group CEO at Mashreq Bank, said despite a tough operating environment, Mashreq continued its positive growth trajectory in the first quarter.
The bank's best-in-class non-interest income to operating income ratio increased to 48.7 per cent, compared to 40.4 per cent over the same period last year.
The package, which extends to new and current Mashreq customers, will provide relief to employees and businesses, particularly in stressed sectors, through assistance such as reduced costs, loan deferrals, reduced interest rates and processing fees, said Abdelaal.
