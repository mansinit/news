Mr Vinals said that overall, about 70 per cent of Standard Chartered’s 86,000-strong workforce was currently working from home.
In Hong Kong, about 50 per cent of staff are now working from home, Mr Vinals said.
“We have some questions on the cyber-security features, and those questions have to be appropriately answered,” said Mr Vinals.
“We have a very small fraction of retail shareholding, and that retail shareholding base is not concentrated in Hong Kong.”
